Use XML tags like <thinking> <verification> and <justification> to separate reasoning, audit verification and the final answer

Some tasks are only required to be done once, other tasks must be performed for each variable. 

1. verify that you have read the audit instructions message (for each variable)

2. verify that you have read the user prompt (only one verification needed)

3. verify that you have read the definitions document (only one verification needed)

4. verify that you have read the incident description "INC-xxx_description" (only one verification needed)

5. verify which codebook variable you are tasked to code (for each variable)

6. verify that you have searched codebook protocols for which protocol applies to the codebook variable (for each variable)

7. verify that you have read the correct protocol (list it by name) that corresponds to that codebook variable (for each variable)

8. verify that you have read each source provided in its entirety (only one verification needed)

9. then think as you evaluate each source to determine what content from any source are most relevant to the codebook variable in question (for each variable)

10. after you've evaluated the sources, think about which variable option(s) you should choose (for each variable)

11. verify that you have read the citations protocol document (only one verification needed)

12. as you follow the citations protocol for gathering and quoting sources relevant to the variable option being considered, think about why each quote does or does not apply

13. think out loud (in written text) if there is any doubt or confusion about whether a quote applies, and include the quote with your reasoning

14. verify that you have read the verifications checklist (only one verification needed)

15. Before you come to the final justification conclusion regarding which variable option you have chosen, think about whether you have met each requirement on the verifications list (for each variable)
 
16. Finally, as you provide your justification for your variable option, think through why this option is the best answer (for each variable)

17. verify that you have read the yaml protocol document (only one verification needed)

18. verify that your final justification is in compliance with the yaml protocol document (only one verification needed)
