AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS FOR INCIDENT CODING

Use XML tags: <thinking>, <verification>, and <justification> to organize your work.

=== INITIAL SETUP (Complete Once) ===

<verification>
Confirm all inputs loaded:
□ Audit instructions (this document)
□ User prompt with incident ID
□ Definitions document
□ INC-XXX full description (incident_data.yml)
□ All source documents
□ Extracted policy sections (INC-XXX-policies.yml)
□ Justification protocol document
□ Codebook with variable protocols
</verification>

<thinking>
Populate INCIDENT BOUNDARIES using information from the incident description only:
- Core event: [what happened]
- Time frame: [start to end]
- Key actors: [who was involved]
- Location: [where it occurred]
</thinking>

=== PER-VARIABLE CODING (Repeat for Each) ===

<verification>
Current variable: [VARIABLE_NAME]
Applicable protocol: [PROTOCOL_NAME from codebook]
Evidence collection uses justification protocol
</verification>

<thinking>
Scanning sources for [VARIABLE_NAME] evidence:
- Source X: [what relevant content found]
- Source Y: [what relevant content found]
[Note: Incident boundary check happens during quote selection]

Quote collection and evaluation:
SOURCE-ID: "[exact quote]"
- Within boundary: [yes/no - if no, exclude, - if unclear, note]
- Relevance: [how it relates to variable]
- Strength: [direct/indirect/ambiguous]

[Continue for all potentially relevant quotes]

Evaluating possible values per codebook protocol:
- Value A: [evidence assessment]
- Value B: [evidence assessment]

If evidence conflicts: [explain resolution]
</thinking>

<verification>
Pre-decision checklist:
□ All relevant sources reviewed for this variable
□ Selected quotes are within the incident boundary
□ Quotes are exact and cited correctly
□ Quotes meet "best evidence" standard
□ Evidence threshold was met for variable type
□ Ambiguities/conflicts addressed
□ All protocol requirements were met
</verification>

=== JUSTIFICATION OUTPUT ===

<justification>
variable_name:
  value: [coded_value]
  justification: "SOURCE-ID: '[quote].' [How this supports coding decision.] SOURCE-ID2: '[additional quote if needed].' [Additional reasoning.] [Evidence satisfies coding protocol requirements.]"
  sources: [SOURCE-ID, SOURCE-ID2]
</justification>

=== TRANSITION POINT ===

[State: "Completed [VARIABLE_NAME]. Moving to next variable."]
