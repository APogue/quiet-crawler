AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS FOR INCIDENT CODING

Use XML tags: <thinking>, <verification>, and <justification> to organize your work.

=== INITIAL SETUP (Complete Once) ===

<verification>
Confirm all inputs loaded:
□ Audit instructions (this document)
□ User prompt with incident ID
□ Definitions document
□ INC-XXX full description
□ All source documents
□ Extracted policy sections (INC-XXX-policies.yml)
□ Justification protocol document
□ Codebook with variable protocols
</verification>

<thinking>
1. INCIDENT BOUNDARIES:
   - Core event: [what happened]
   - Time frame: [start to end]
   - Key actors: [who was involved]
   - Location: [where it occurred]
   - Exclude: [what's outside scope]

2. RELEVANT PASSAGES IDENTIFIED: (this is going to be way too much context window overhead)
   [List source passages that relate to this incident]
</thinking>

=== PER-VARIABLE CODING (Repeat for Each) ===

<verification>
Current variable: [VARIABLE_NAME]
Applicable protocol: [PROTOCOL_NAME from codebook]
</verification>

<thinking>
Which sources contain information relevant to [VARIABLE_NAME]?
- Source X: [relevant because...]
- Source Y: [relevant because...]

Possible values based on protocol:
- Value A: [evidence for/against]
- Value B: [evidence for/against]
</thinking>

<justification> should be <thinking>
Gathering quotes for [VARIABLE_NAME]:

Quote 1: "[exact quote]" (Source: XX)
- Relevance: [why this matters]
- Ambiguity: [any uncertainty about application]

Quote 2: "[exact quote]" (Source: YY)
- Relevance: [why this matters]
- Ambiguity: [any uncertainty about application]

[Continue for all relevant quotes]
</justification>

<verification> It eliminated "verifications checklist" from the initial verification step, does that mean it should be kept here?
Pre-decision checklist:
□ All relevant sources reviewed for this variable
□ Quotes are exact and sourced
□ Ambiguities explicitly noted
□ Protocol requirements met
</verification>

<justification> should be <thinking>
FINAL DECISION: [VARIABLE_NAME] = [VALUE]

Rationale: [Why this value best fits the evidence, referencing specific quotes and protocol criteria]
</justification>

=== TRANSITION POINT ===
[State: "Completed coding for [VARIABLE_NAME]. Moving to next variable."]
[This serves as attention refresh between variables]

=== FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT ===

<verification>
All variables coded per YAML protocol and variable type (metadata, simple, complex, etc.):
<justification>
```yaml
variable:
   value: coded_value
   justification: "SOURCE-ID: 'exact quote.' [Brief explanation of how quote supports coding decision.]"
   sources: [SOURCE-ID, etc.]
  [etc.]
  ```
