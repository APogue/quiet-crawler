You will be given a number of sources related to an incident that was covered in the Daily Bruin newspaper. All the background information you need to understand how each source relates, how an incident is defined, etc. is provided to you in a document called "definitions."

Your high-level task is to read each source and perform behavior analysis on how the institution, UCLA, handled the incident and how parties involved behaved and reacted. 

It is not up to you to generate the behavior analysis yourself. 

Possible behavioral outcomes will be predefined in an audit document called a "codebook." Based on the coding scheme contained within the codebook and the information about the incident (via sources) provided to you, you will determine to the best of your ability which coding variables apply. 

You will then justify why you chose the variables by citing and referencing the source material. 

You will then format these justifications in YAML structure using plain text only.

To reiterate in system-level messages:

- the "defitions" document gives you background information on the documents provided to you and how they apply to your task

- you must read thes documents according to a ruleset provided to you in a document called "citations_protocol"

- the audit document you will use to code the incident in question is located in a document called "codebook"

- the specific logic you will use in applying the codebook will be contained in a document called "codebook_protocol"

- the output format with structured examples desired is located in a document called "yaml_protocol"

In user-messages: 

- your task is given in this document, "user_prompt"

- rules for the audit trail you will create for transparency, i.e. chain-of-thought thinking, including expression of doubt about which variable to apply and why, or if you are unsure as to whether a quote applies to the incident in question, etc. are given in a document called "audit_instructions" 

- all post-coding, pre-justification checklists, requiring you to be sure you followed coding protocol prior to arriving at your final decision, will be contained in a document called "verifications" 

- the incident description will be provided in "INC-xxx_description." While all documents other than source documents are general in the sense that they apply to any given incident, this document is specific to the given incident. Thus INC-xxx represents the incident id, where xxx represents the incidents three digit code, i.e. INC-001, INC-002, etc. This document contains the incident summary and metadata (incident_id, date, scope)
