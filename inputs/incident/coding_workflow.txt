INCIDENT CODING WORKFLOW

=== TASK OVERVIEW ===

You are analyzing a campus incident using a structured behavioral coding system.

OBJECTIVE: Code each variable in the codebook based on evidence from provided sources. Your task is to:
1. Identify evidence relevant to the variable being coded
2. Apply codebook variable definitions to that evidence  
3. Select the most appropriate value for each variable
4. Justify your coding decisions with exact source citations and explanation

This is systematic evidence analysis, not interpretation or opinion.

Use XML tags: <thinking>, <verification>, and <justification> to organize your work.

=== INITIAL SETUP (Complete Once) ===

<verification>
Confirm all inputs loaded and reviewed:
□ Coding workflow (coding_workflow.txt) - complete methodology
□ Definitions document (definitions.txt) - background information, nomenclature, meta-rules, source types
□ INC-XXX full description (incident_message) - incident-specific summary and scope
□ All source documents (sources/*.txt files listed in INC-XXX description) - evidence base
□ Extracted policy sections (INC-XXX-policies.yml) - institutional rules and standards
□ Justification protocol document (justification_protocol.txt) - evidence gathering workflow and citation format requirements
□ Codebook (codebook.md) - variable definitions and valid values
□ Codebook with variable protocols (codebook_with_protocols.md) - logic for applying codebook
</verification>

<thinking>
Populate INCIDENT BOUNDARIES using information from the incident description only:
- Core event: [what happened]
- Time frame: [start to end]
- Key actors: [who was involved]
- Location: [where it occurred]
</thinking>

=== PER-VARIABLE CODING (Repeat for Each) ===

<verification>
Current variable: [VARIABLE_NAME]
Applicable protocol: [PROTOCOL_NAME from codebook]
Evidence collection uses justification protocol
</verification>

<thinking>
Scanning sources for [VARIABLE_NAME] evidence:
- Source X: [what relevant content found]
- Source Y: [what relevant content found]
[Note: Incident boundary check happens during quote selection]

Quote collection and evaluation:
SOURCE-ID: "[exact quote]"
- Within boundary: [yes/no - if no, exclude, - if unclear, note]
- Relevance: [how it relates to variable]
- Strength: [direct/indirect/ambiguous]

[Continue for all potentially relevant quotes]

Evaluating possible values per codebook protocol:
- Value A: [evidence assessment]
- Value B: [evidence assessment]

If evidence conflicts: [explain resolution]
</thinking>

<verification>
Pre-decision checklist:
□ All relevant sources reviewed for this variable
□ Selected quotes are within the incident boundary
□ Quotes are exact and cited correctly
□ Quotes meet "best evidence" standard
□ Evidence threshold was met for variable type
□ Ambiguities/conflicts addressed
□ All protocol requirements were met
</verification>

=== JUSTIFICATION OUTPUT ===

<justification>
variable_name:
  value: [coded_value]
  justification: "SOURCE-ID: '[quote].' [How this supports coding decision.] SOURCE-ID2: '[additional quote if needed].' [Additional reasoning.] [Evidence satisfies coding protocol requirements.]"
  sources: [SOURCE-ID, SOURCE-ID2]
</justification>

=== TRANSITION POINT ===

[State: "Completed [VARIABLE_NAME]. Moving to next variable."]
