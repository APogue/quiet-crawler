Return your output in YAML structure using plain text only.

Do not wrap your YAML in backticks or markdown code blocks. Do not insert any introductory explanation or conclusion. Simply begin with the first variable and continue until the last.

Use this format:

actor_student:
  value: true
  justification: 'SOC-003: "The protest was organized by students." No contrary evidence.'
  sources: [SOC-003]

Each variable block must be complete, indented consistently, and valid YAML syntax.


- Use YAML structure in plain text (no markdown backticks)
- Begin with the first variable (e.g., actor_student:)
- Indent two spaces for child fields (value, justification, sources)
- Format source lists as: sources: [SOC-003, DB-045]


For each incident, produce a YAML file following this exact structure:

incident_id: INC-XXX
date: YYYY-MM-DD
source_ids: [SOURCE-001, SOURCE-002, ...]
keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, ...]

# For media_coverage_level specifically
media_coverage_level:
  value: selected_level
  justification: "Following the media_coverage_level protocol: SOURCE-001: \"Exact quote about coverage.\" I have identified exactly X qualifying sources: [list each source]. Of these, the following have general public reach: [name specific sources and explain why]. This meets the criteria for [selected_level] because [explain how thresholds are met]."

# For insufficient evidence cases
insufficient_variable:
