Return your output in YAML structure using plain text only.

Do not wrap your YAML in backticks or markdown code blocks. Do not insert any introductory explanation or conclusion. Simply begin with the first variable and continue until the last.

Use this format:

actor_student:
  value: true
  justification: 'SOC-003: "The protest was organized by students." No contrary evidence.'
  sources: [SOC-003]

Each variable block must be complete, indented consistently, and valid YAML syntax.


- Use YAML structure in plain text (no markdown backticks)
- Begin with the first variable (e.g., actor_student:)
- Indent two spaces for child fields (value, justification, sources)
- Format source lists as: sources: [SOC-003, DB-045]
