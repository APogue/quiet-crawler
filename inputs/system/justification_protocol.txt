Mandatory source processing: 
Check sources systematically until sufficient evidence is found for the variable in question. Sufficient evidence is a quantity threshold not a quality threshold, thus a systematic search means you have found a set of quotes that are relevant to the variable and have then chosen the best quality subset to meet the sufficient evidence standard. If your search is not thorough, you will not be guaranteed to find the best quality subset of quotes. You should attempt to find the best quality subset of quotes. 

“Sufficient evidence” varies by variable type:

- For factual variables (dates, locations): One clear source is usually sufficient
- For subjective variables (tone, positioning): YOU MUST use multiple sources to establish a pattern
- For complex variables (policy violations): YOU MUST cross-referencing multiple policy documents
- Every claim must be supported by specific quotes with source attribution
- Connect quotes to coding decision with clear reasoning in you justification
- If NO direct evidence exists for a variable, code as “insufficient evidence”

Mandotory citation requirements:
Reference sources EXCLUSIVELY by the exact filename/source ID provided, the filename and source ID are the same (e.g., “ADM-001”, “DB-001”, “SOC-006”). When citing a source, place the source ID(s) inline with the quote(s) and explanation(s), e.g. SOURCE [ID]: “[exact quote]”, etc. When multiple sources support a decision, cite the source(s) with the strongest/clearest evidence. When evidence is ambiguous or conflicting, YOU MUST think through why this is the case and include a quote of the content in question under a <thinking> tag (this task is also given in audit instructions).

Depending on which variable you are coding, any of the below examples are appropriate. For each justification, the source ID and quote MUST BE present, but the exact construction of the justification body is left to your discretion.

Under the <justification> tag use YAML structure using plain text only.

- Use YAML structure in plain text (no markdown backticks)
- Begin with the first variable (e.g., actor_student:)
- Indent two spaces for child fields (value, justification, sources)
- Format source lists as: sources: [SOC-003, DB-045]

Each variable block must be complete, indented consistently, and valid YAML syntax.

<justification>
  incident_id: INC-001
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  source_ids: [list of actually provided source files]
  keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, ...]

<justification>
  simple_variable:
    value: coded_value
    justification: "SOURCE-ID: 'exact quote.' [Brief explanation of how quote supports coding decision.]"
    sources: [SOURCE-ID, etc.]

<justification>
  # For variables requiring multiple sources/evidence types
  complex_variable:
    value: coded_value
    justification: "SOURCE-ID1: 'quote supporting aspect 1.' SOURCE-ID2: quote supporting aspect 2. 2.' [Explanation of combined evidence.], etc."
    sources: [SOURCE-ID1, SOURCE-ID2, etc.]

<justification>
  # For insufficient evidence cases
  insufficient_variable:
    value: "insufficient evidence"
    justification: "No direct evidence found in provided sources regarding [specific aspect]."
    sources: []
