JUSTIFICATION PROTOCOL

## Source Processing Requirements

Coding variable overview:
1. Scan ALL provided sources for content relevant to the variable
2. Collect quotes from relevant content that are within the incident boundary and relate to the variable (regardless of initial quality)
3. Filter quotes: select the quotes that make the strongest case for or against a particular variable value
4. Evidence assessment: assess value appropriateness based on quotes 
5. Select the most appropriate value as your final answer: package the quotes that serve as evidence and the reason why your value choice best fits this evidence in a justification block in yaml format. Mention how the justification satisfies coding protocol criteria where appropriate. 

Evidence thresholds by variable type:
- Factual variables (dates, locations): One authoritative source
- Interpretive variables (tone, positioning): Multiple sources showing a pattern
- Policy-based variables: Cross-reference incident facts with mutliple policy texts
- If NO direct evidence exists for a variable, code as “insufficient evidence”

## Citation Requirements

- Use exact source IDs as provided (e.g., "ADM-001", "DB-001")
- Format: Inline SOURCE-ID: "[exact quote]" and explanation
- Quote selection: prioritize direct/most explicit/clearest evidence
- Quotes are verbatim

## Special Handling

When evidence conflicts or is ambiguous:
<thinking>
Conflicting evidence for [variable]:
SOURCE-1: "[quote suggesting Value X]"
SOURCE-2: "[quote suggesting Value Y]"
Resolution: [reasoning for final choice]
</thinking>

## Output Format

Use plain YAML under <justification> tags, below are examples. Appropriate application and exact construction are left to your discretion:

<justification>
  incident_id: INC-001
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  source_ids: [list of actually provided source files]
  keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, ...]
</justification>

<justification>
  simple_variable:
    value: coded_value
    justification: "SOURCE-ID: 'exact quote.' [Brief explanation of how quote supports coding decision.]"
    sources: [SOURCE-ID, etc.]
</justification>

For variables requiring multiple sources/evidence types
<justification>
  complex_variable:
    value: coded_value
    justification: "SOURCE-ID1: 'quote supporting aspect 1.' SOURCE-ID2: quote supporting aspect 2.' [Explanation of combined evidence.], etc."
    sources: [SOURCE-ID1, SOURCE-ID2, etc.]
</justification>

For insufficient evidence cases
<justification>
  insufficient_variable:
    value: "insufficient evidence"
    justification: "No direct evidence found in provided sources regarding [specific aspect]."
    sources: []
</justification>
