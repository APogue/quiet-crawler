Study definition:
A case-based analysis of how universities respond to campus incidents involving identity-based harm, protest, policy violations, or campus safety failures. Each incident is coded using a fixed set of variables, based on evidence from public sources, to compare patterns in administrative action, media framing, and student narratives.

Incident:
A discrete, campus-affiliated event—documented in the Daily Bruin—that occurs within a specific timeframe and involves identity-based harm, protest-related activity, TPM violations, or campus safety failures. An incident must be clearly bounded in time and produce measurable community impact, administrative or police involvement, or a clear escalation of verbal conflict or physical disruption. It must be distinguishable from ongoing policy discourse or general campus climate issues.

The incident summary is a summary provided that briefly describes the incident and discusses the event, actors, locaton and timeframe. The incident scope defines the people, places, locations, events, dates etc. that are considered a part of the incident. Anything outside of this boundary can be general campus climate, similar but distinct incidents or contextual information, among other things that make up broader issues that the sources provided may cover. The incident summary and scope are designed to aid in isolation of the incident in question from other less relevant information contained in source documents.

Sources 














An incident refers to a discrete, bounded event involving harm, escalation, or administrative response.

When evaluating sources:
- Prioritize content that clearly describes or directly impacts this specific incident.
- Do not rely on generalized background, unless the source **explicitly connects it** to the incident's events, timeline, actors, or reactions.
- However, if a quote provides *reasonable support* for describing harm, behavior, response, or framing **relevant to the incident**, it may be included — even if not all context is spelled out.

When in doubt:
- Include the quote in the `quote_inventory`, with a brief note on why it might be relevant.
- Downstream YAML decisions will determine whether it qualifies under codebook thresholds.




If you are unsure whether a quote applies to the incident, extract it and add a note: "Possibly relevant — requires confirmation during YAML coding."

Source Type Definitions:
DB - Daily Bruin

Definition: Official student newspaper of UCLA
Role: Primary inclusion filter and neutral incident detection source
Content: News articles, op-eds, investigative reporting on campus events
Authority: Student-run independent journalism; campus paper of record
Usage: Keyword searches identify incidents; articles provide initial incident framing and timeline

ADM - Administrative Sources

Definition: Official UCLA institutional communications and statements
Includes:
Chancellor messages and statements
UCLA Newsroom releases
Official university social media accounts
Administrative emails and policy announcements

Authority: Represents official institutional position and response
Usage: Documents formal university stance, policy actions, and administrative interventions

MED - External Media

Definition: Non-UCLA journalistic sources and news outlets
Includes:
Regional newspapers (LA Times, etc.)
National news outlets
Specialty publications (Jewish Journal, etc.)
Professional journalism sources

Authority: External perspective and broader contextual coverage
Usage: Provides outside verification, community impact assessment, and broader narrative context

SOC - Social Media

Definition: User-generated content on social media platforms
Includes:
Twitter/X posts
Instagram posts and stories
Reddit discussions
TikTok videos

Authority: Direct participant and community voices; real-time documentation
Usage: Captures immediate reactions, participant perspectives, visual evidence, and community discourse

POL - Policy Documents

Definition: Official UC Regents and/or UCLA policies and regulations
Includes:
Student Conduct Code
Time, place, and manner (TPM) policies
Anti-discrimination policies
Non-affiliate conduct regulations

Authority: Legal/regulatory framework governing campus conduct
Usage: Provides policy context for violations, procedures, and sanctions; establishes standards for evaluating incident compliance. 

PHIL - Philosophical/Guidance Documents

Definition: Educational materials and guidance documents on principles and values
Includes:
Free speech guidance documents
Equity, Diversity & Inclusion educational materials
Training documents and frameworks
Best practices guidance
Principled approaches to campus issues

Authority: Institutional values and educational guidance 
Usage: Provides context for institutional principles, educational approaches, and value frameworks that inform but don't mandate responses

Key Distinction: POL sources establish standards for evaluating compliance, but whether an incident meets that standard is discretionary and must be weighed against UCLA's responsibility to the constitution as a state actor. PHIL sources are imperative in determining whether an incident rises to the level of a policy violation and must be considered in analysis.
