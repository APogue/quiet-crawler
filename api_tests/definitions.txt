Incident:
A discrete, campus-affiliated event—documented in the Daily Bruin—that occurs within a specific timeframe and involves identity-based harm, protest-related activity, TPM violations, or campus safety failures. An incident must be clearly bounded in time and produce measurable community impact, administrative or police involvement, or a clear escalation of verbal conflict or physical disruption. It must be distinguishable from ongoing policy discourse or general campus climate issues.




An incident refers to a discrete, bounded event involving harm, escalation, or administrative response.

When evaluating sources:
- Prioritize content that clearly describes or directly impacts this specific incident.
- Do not rely on generalized background, unless the source **explicitly connects it** to the incident's events, timeline, actors, or reactions.
- However, if a quote provides *reasonable support* for describing harm, behavior, response, or framing **relevant to the incident**, it may be included — even if not all context is spelled out.

When in doubt:
- Include the quote in the `quote_inventory`, with a brief note on why it might be relevant.
- Downstream YAML decisions will determine whether it qualifies under codebook thresholds.




If you are unsure whether a quote applies to the incident, extract it and add a note: "Possibly relevant — requires confirmation during YAML coding."

Student Conduct Code
Time, place, and manner (TPM) policies
Anti-discrimination policies

PHIL - Philosophical/Guidance Documents

Key Distinction: POL sources establish standards for evaluating compliance, but whether an incident meets that standard is discretionary and must be weighed against UCLA's responsibility to the constitution as a state actor. PHIL sources are imperative in determining whether an incident rises to the level of a policy violation and must be considered in analysis.
