Since Oct. 7, our campus – like so many across the country – has been the site of intense and often tense discourse and action. The divide between those who support the cause of Palestinian liberation and those who support Israel’s right to exist has deepened more than at any point in my 32 years at UCLA, creating a seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the two sides.

It has also created, at various points in time, a sense of unsafety among many members of the university community, especially students. This too tracks larger national trends, according to a 2024 report that shows that 56% of Jewish university students polled after Oct. 7 felt in personal danger, and 52% of Muslim students felt in personal danger.

It is not just a sense of safety that has fallen into the abyss. It is the ability to grasp complexity and nuance in making sense of the violent world we live in.

Sadly, there are too few voices – at least, audible ones – that are willing to acknowledge, at once, the Hamas-perpetrated massacre of Oct. 7 and the ongoing devastation that Israel has wrought in Gaza. In fact, it is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land they inhabit.

Another victim of the current moment is the ability to extend beyond ourselves to understand the other, especially those with whom one disagrees. A startling example of that failing appeared on our campus March 20 to 21 in the form of a statue placed near the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center, where the UC Board of Regents was meeting. The regents’ meeting attracted protesters who bore signs and uttered chants calling for divestment from companies that have ties to the Israeli military. Alongside these signs, someone placed in the designated free speech area next to the regents’ meeting a statue that depicted a pig holding a bag of money in one hand and a birdcage with a keffiyeh in the other.

To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible not to recoil. Since the 13th century, Jews have been associated with pigs – or, more accurately, with their coarse and animal-like quality. Medieval Christian Europe was replete with statues and carvings of the Judensau, the so-called “Jews’ pig,” which depicted Jews suckling at the udders of a sow. The image of this desperate and filthy act stands in stark contrast to the religiously mandated abstinence of Jews from consuming pork.

Indeed, for Jews – as well as for Muslims – the pig is the epitome of uncleanliness, reflecting the kind of perverse paradox on which anti-Jewish and other group-based hate rests. Ironic as the association may have been, it did not die in the Middle Ages; rather, it became a feature of Nazi propaganda that cast Jews as Judenschwein, meaning Jewish pigs. And since that time, antisemites have equated Jews with pigs, or worse, hurled pig parts at Jews to express their revulsion.

So too the juxtaposition between a hand holding a birdcage – presumably to symbolize the lack of freedom of Palestinians – and a hand holding a bag of money triggers alarms for those familiar with the history of antisemitism. Haters of Jews, such as the late 19th-century French author Édouard Drumont, have repeatedly cast them as avaricious, money-grubbing, materialistic and intent on global economic domination. Antisemites branded the Rothschilds, the wealthy European Jewish banking family, as the living embodiment of the Jewish quest to monopolize the world for their own self-interest.

It is hard not to see the staging of the two hands – the upper hand holding money and the lower hand holding the birdcage – as a visual representation of Jews’ domination of Palestinians. But what would seem to be the real tell with respect to the statue’s ultimate meaning is the blue and white bucket at the bottom left of the pig, which is emblazoned with a star of David.

Again, to anyone familiar with the repertoire of antisemitic images, it is hard to regard the assemblage of the pig, bag of money and star of David as anything other than a case of antisemitism that taps into deeply ingrained stereotypes.

In our current moment, when we vilify first and ask second, it is necessary to ask the builders of the statue: What did you have in mind? Did you have some other aim or intent than to trigger antisemitic associations? Were you trying to excoriate Israel in some way without identifying it with Jews, avarice and a pig?

If so, then it is important to recognize that the statue was deeply wounding to many members of the campus community. The cause of justice, equality and freedom for Palestinians, which many Jews strongly support, will not be advanced by recourse to antisemitic stereotypes. Even if such an offense were not your intent, it was the effect.

A good next step would be to learn more about the history of antisemitism so as to resist the impulse to conflate the critique of Israel with the ugliest misrepresentations of Jews.

Episodes such as this can all too easily widen the chasm between groups and create rifts among those who might otherwise have stood together in solidarity.

But perhaps we have a chance to use this as a teachable moment in which we recommit to a campus where difficult conversations can be had without disparaging and wounding one another. To do so requires honesty, a measure of modesty about what we know and don’t know, a willingness to take ownership of our words and deeds and, above all, the capacity to engage in self-criticism to learn from our mistakes.

The stakes are high for the health of our university community, so let us not squander the opportunity.

Campus condemns antisemitic caricature at UC Regents meeting
March 28, 2024

share iconShare
UCLA issued a statement in response to an appalling and hateful display at a UC Board of Regents meeting.

We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University of California Board of Regents meeting on our campus in mid-March. The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been removed. Hateful and racist depictions like this are a complete affront to UCLA’s Principles of Community and True Bruin Values, and to the diverse, inclusive academic community we aim to cultivate. 

It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity. We remain committed to doing all we can to support the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus.

UCLA Condemns “Ugly Antisemitic” Pig Display
Demonstration was outside meeting of UC Board of Regents

UCLA issued a statement denouncing a display depicting a pig holding a bag of cash and a Star of David cannister that was on campus earlier this week.

The Israel War Room X account posted an image of the display on Thursday, March 21; the display had the words “UC Regents” in front of flames and a clock behind it that said, “Time is running out.” The display was in front of the UCLA Luskin Conference Center, where the UC Board of Regents were holding their meeting.

In an email to community members on Thursday, UCLA Hillel Executive Director Dan Gold wrote that “BDS activists camped out” and made a scene, including “ugly displays and slogans.” “This has become routine … yet we cannot accept it as normal!” he added. Gold told the Journal in a text message that Jewish students “were very disturbed, upset and concerned” about the pig display.

“The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a University of California campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing every day. Students and faculty across California are impacted by this hateful bigotry and it must come to an end.” – Jeffrey Abrams

Anti-Defamation League Los Angeles Regional Director Jeffrey I. Abrams said in a statement posted to social media, “The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a University of California campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing every day. Students and faculty across California are impacted by this hateful bigotry and it must come to an end.” Abrams urged the UC Regents to “denounce this antisemitic display and make clear that there is no tolerance for antisemitism on University campuses. Their silence on this issue is complicity.”

In a Friday statement to the Journal, the university said: “We are offended and deeply saddened by the ugly antisemitic caricature that was displayed as part of a protest aimed at the University of California Board of Regents that met at UCLA on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. The protest has ended and the display has been removed. Ethnic slurs and racist depictions are an affront to UCLA’s Principles of Community and True Bruin Values, and to the diverse, inclusive academic community we aim to cultivate. It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity, and we remain committed to doing all we can to ensure the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus.”

Gold also noted in his email that the UC Regents President Michael Drake announced during the meeting that the 10 UC campuses will be partnering with the Hillel Campus Initiative, which Gold called “a welcome and necessary step to better address campus antisemitism and take meaningful action to ensure our campuses are free of hate and fully accepting and inclusionary for all Jewish students, faculty and community members.”

According to The Los Angeles Times, one of the issues discussed during the UC Regents meeting was a proposal requiring faculty departments to put any polemical commentary statements up to a vote before posting and clarifying who exactly they are speaking on behalf of. The proposal would also require that faculty polemical commentary be posted on a webpage clearly marked as an opinion page that’s not speaking on the behalf of the university. The proposal has been tabled until May; when it was first introduced by Regent Jay Sures, pro-Palestinian protesters shouted “shame on you!” and accused Sures of attempting to censor their point of view.

Also during the meeting, Jewish students spoke out during public comment, where they denounced the “growing harassment against faculty and students who support Israel, including a ‘barrage’ of unjustified negative student evaluations of faculty, classes disrupted by protests, swastikas painted on buildings and signs calling Jews ‘the new Nazis,’” the Times reported. A pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest “from firms that support the ‘ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing’ of Palestinians,” per the Times.

Main text: "UCLA: A figure depicting Jews as pigs suggesting Jews "prioritize money over lives"."
Secondary text: "Remember, it's "Anti-Zionism" only, definitely not Antisemitism...."

The Photo Below the Text Description
A full-color photograph of a life-size satirical sculpture or “effigy” displayed outdoors on a paved quad with grass, trees, and a campus building visible in the background. The centerpiece is a humanoid figure with:

The head is a round, bright-pink papier-mâché pig’s head with pointed ears, two black dot eyes, a snout with two dark nostrils, and a wide grey grin showing square teeth. The torso and clothing consist of a black suit jacket, a white dress-shirt collar peeking out, a red pocket square in the left breast pocket, and a loose rope “tie” hanging from the neck. The arms are long, thin, hot-pink pig arms, both held straight out to either side in a broad “T” shape. The right hand (viewer’s left) is gripping a large grey cloth sack printed with a bold black dollar-sign; the sack hangs heavy, suggesting it is full of money. The left hand (viewer’s right) has a wrist wrapped in a black-and-white keffiyeh-patterned cloth, and from it dangles a small wire birdcage holding plastic flowers. The backdrop sign is a white circular disk mounted behind the pig’s head on a pole, with two thick black arrows pointing diagonally upward, crossing like clock hands at eleven-and-two o’clock. Curved red lettering around the rim reads “TIME IS RUNNING OUT.” The base platform is a low rectangular wooden pallet painted orange. Around the pig’s legs are crumpled, bright-red and yellow tissue “flames,” suggesting the figure is burning. The front edge displays a cardboard sign in varsity-style red-outlined letters: “UC REGENTS.” At ground level, in front of the flames, sits a white bucket with a blue lid and a hand-drawn blue Star of David, next to several newspaper pages against the base of the pigs body. Lighting is mid-day sun from the upper left; the figure casts shadows onto the paving. The photo is taken at roughly chest height, centered on the effigy.

Context
This appears to be an official ADL statement responding to the antisemitic display at UCLA (likely referencing the pig effigy from the previous image) during a UC Regents meeting. The post serves as both documentation of the ADL's response and a call to action for the UC Regents to take a public stance against antisemitism on campus.

Accessory above the head: Stuck behind the head is a white circular clock mounted on a stick. Only the lower edge and a couple of red capital letters of its message are visible inside this crop.

Body & clothing: The figure wears an oversized navy-blue men’s blazer with a small red pocket square. Its stick-arms stretch outward at shoulder height as if gesturing. A heavy metal chain drapes around one shoulder. Figure appears to have a noose around its neck with the end of the twine/rope attached to the base platform, or maybe attached to a sign at the front of the base reading "REGENT" (the entire word is cropped in this video still).

Lower section / symbolism: From the mannequin’s waist down, vivid red-orange tissue paper flames billow upward, suggesting the effigy is burning. Mixed into the “fire” are scattered newspaper articles, and a blue-and-white bucket bearing the Star of David. A cardboard placard on the front edge of the base shows part of a phrase with the visible part reading “REGENTS” in large red letters with black outline.

Setting: The effigy stands on the outdoor concrete plaza in front of tall glass doors of a modern building. Reflections in the glass hint at sunny weather.

Background figures: Off to the right, two individuals in casual clothes stand chatting. One wears a white T-shirt with a colorful back-print, black pants, and white sneakers. It also looks like the same individual is wearing a white scarf draped around their neck with black pattern, maybe a keffiyeh. Their faces are turned away from the camera.

Video UI: A mute/speaker icon sits in the bottom-right corner of the video thumbnail.

    Coming back to this after my initial response a few hours ago to see a vibrant discussion. One thing that strikes me is how people are viewing this same effigy in very different ways depending on their own colored lenses / world view.

For many readers, myself included, this is very clearly a denunciation of the political situation in Israel and Gaza and the UC Regents role in it. I see NO anti-Semitic tropes here. The Israeli flag is essential as a symbol of Israel (no it's not a commentary on Jews). The Palestinian scarf is necessary as a symbol of Palestinians in Gaza with what seems to be flowers for their graves. The depiction of the regents as pigs shows them as greedy, not as Jewish (what does that even mean?). The money shows how the regents have prioritized money. Others have more eloquently described the meaning behind this protest.

One commenter below claimed that:

>pig person holding money bags next to Jewish star = pure antisemitism.

This appears to be a purposeful or subconscious misinterpretation of the symbolism. Again, pigs depict the regents. Money bags are how the regents hands are tied by greed and prioritizing money over Palestinian lives (which are seen in the pig's other hand, as symbolized by the Palestinian scarf). The Jewish star is on the Israeli flag - it's not representing Jews - it's representing Israel.

This is so clearly a political statement against Israeli policy of indiscriminate death and destruction in Gaza, and a denunciation of UC Regents milk toast response.

And nope, not everything denouncing Israeli policy is anti-Semitic. If we can't denounce atrocities being committed by governments and regimes due to fear of being labeled an anti-Semite (or anti-whatever depending on the country), it will be a very scary world indeed.

I’m interpreting the intent of this symbolism through my worldview based on my lived experience as a Jew. For you to explain that away as “a purposeful or subconscious misinterpretation” is gross.

        While it is possible that the creator of the display had antisemitic intentions behind the choice of the pig, the "UC REGENTS" label at the bottom makes this seem less likely to me—the message is presumably not that the Regents are all Jews, but that the Regents are "pigs", in that they are greedy people who prioritize financial gain, including through investment in Israeli companies, over the lives of the residents of Gaza. Pigs are commonly used as a symbol of greed with no ethnoreligious connotations, as several dictionaries' entries for *pig* indicate:

* "Someone who is like the popular image of a pig, dirty, greedy, gluttonous, or cantankerous (also used mildly in reproach)" (Chambers Dictionary)
* "**Informal** a greedy, dirty, or unpleasant person: *you're such a pig when it comes to sleep.*" (New Oxford American Dictionary)
* "**informal** A dirty, greedy, or bad-mannered person" (Collins English Dictionary)

If the pig was chosen with antisemitic intent, the plausible deniability provided by this usage could have also been a factor. We may never know for certain.

        Notice the words "UC REGENTS" under the pig. Clearly indicating that it is in fact representing the UC regents, putting money in the tin for Israel. 

A pig is a universal sign for greed and you could more than easily find numerous examples of capitalists and rich assholes being betrayed as pigs. You could call Animal Farm anti-Semitic, because of that reason. 

Only a couple of weeks ago people were accusing Greta Thunberg of all people of being anti-Semitic, because she had an octopus plushy. People have been racist to Jewish people for a very long time and have probably used every type of symbology that can be used. 

So, in this instance, if you parse the symbology here as literally as you can, it brushes past a lot of feelings that could be connected to totally normal anxieties about anti-semitism. But Israel isn't Judaism. And people can protest support of Israel's genocide by the regents without being anti-Semitic.

    You can oppose Israeli policy without being antisemitic, but this isn’t an example of that. Comparing Jews to pigs is an extremely common antisemitic trope. I actually don’t think you could make a more overtly antisemitic effigy if you tried.

If this were about Israel, why doesn’t it say it anywhere? It has a Star of David, but isn’t painted the way the Star of David on the Israeli flag is. Why is the pig carrying a bag of money? (It’s obviously playing on another antisemitic trope.) How are we supposed to interpret the noose around the pig’s neck? If it were about Israel and not Jews, shouldn’t the people who made it have been cautious not to use antisemitic tropes so that the message wasn’t misconstrued?

In summary, your take is complete bullshit. The point of this is clear to every Jewish person who sees it. It doesn’t matter if someone says “oh it’s actually about (((Zionists))).” I don’t think I or other Jewish students can possibly feel safe on campus when there are protests sanctioned by student organizations where the message is clearly “we want to lynch Jews”.

If this were a KKK cross being burnt, nobody would say "oh, well, it's probably protesting the Sudanese genocide, why are black people upset?" If this depicted a Muslim dressed up to look like a Hamas member with an AK-47, suicide vest, blood, and symbols of Islam, nobody would say "oh, well, it's probably protesting October 7th". The protests in either case would be enormous, and either would be a national news story. To pretend otherwise is disingenuous, and to suddenly realize the importance of free speech when you would be outraged in any other case is anti-semitism.

Introduction
In order to carry out the objectives of teaching, research, and public service, the University has an obligation to maintain conditions under which the work of the University can go forward freely, in accordance with the highest standards of quality, institutional integrity, and freedom of expression, with full recognition by all concerned of the rights and privileges, as well as the responsibilities, of those who comprise the University community. UCLA students assume these privileges and responsibilities upon admission and cannot use ignorance of these policies as a justification for violating community standards.

UCLA’s reputation for academic excellence and institutional integrity is among our most valued assets; as such, academic integrity is of paramount importance to our institution and it is vital that the institution do all within our power to maintain these standards.

As a leader in health and health care, as well as environmental research, policy, practice, and education, UCLA has implemented a Tobacco-Free policy to create a healthy environment for all those who learn, work, and spend much of their time at UCLA. See UCLA Policy 810 – Tobacco-Free Environment.

Guided by our UCLA Principles of Community, we strive to provide and maintain an inclusive excellence that encompasses our high academic standards and the recognition that diversity is essential to maintaining this standard of excellence.

Students are members of both society and the academic community with attendant rights and responsibilities. Students are expected to make themselves aware of and comply with the law, and with University and campus policies and regulations. While many of UCLA’s policies and regulations parallel federal, state and local laws, UCLA’s standards may be set higher.

The regulations within the UCLA Student Conduct Code (“Code”) have been developed to create and maintain a safe, supportive, and inclusive campus community that engages students in order to foster their academic success, personal growth and responsible citizenship. Students are considered to be maturing adults, capable of making their own decisions, as well as accepting the consequences for those decisions. The student conduct process has been established to respond to incidents involving allegations of prohibited behavior within our community. This process provides educational opportunities which encourage students to evaluate their own actions, consider their own decision making, and acquire new skills to improve their choices in the future.

The University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment and University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students (UC PACAOS) have been incorporated into the UCLA Student Conduct Code either by adapting or inserting verbatim the language of the policies.

Under the UCLA Student Group Conduct Code, Student Groups may be subject to disciplinary action as a result of actions of individual members of the group while acting in concert with or representing the group. Individual students can also be held accountable for their individual behavior as part of a group, as student group leaders, or signatories for the consequences of a group’s programs, activities, or behaviors.

In accordance with applicable Federal and State law and University policy, UCLA does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or service in the uniformed services. The University also prohibits sexual harassment. This nondiscrimination policy covers admission and access to as well as behaviors in all University programs and activities, including the programs and activities sponsored by Student Groups.

Students may contact the Office of Student Conduct or Student Legal Services for more information concerning these policies.

I. Definitions
A. Advisor
An Advisor is any individual accompanying a Student throughout the review process. The Advisor may be any person, including an advocate, attorney, friend, or parent, who is not otherwise a party or witness involved in the review process. A Student may be accompanied by their Advisor at any meeting or proceeding that is part of the review process. While the Advisor may provide support, guidance and advice to the Student that the Advisor is accompanying, the Advisor may not speak on behalf of the Student or otherwise actively participate in, or in any manner disrupt any meetings or proceeding.

B. Campus
The term “campus” means a University of California location, including the Office of the President, the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and each Department of Energy Laboratory operated by the University.

C. Days
For purposes of this policy, the term “Days” means University business days. It does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or days on which the campus is closed.

D. Dean
For the purposes of this policy, the term “Dean” refers to the Dean of Students or the Dean’s designee assigned to facilitate the administrative student conduct review.

E. Hearing Administrator
The Hearing Administrator is a University employee designated to administer the proceedings of matters related to the Student Conduct Committee (see Section III.K).

F. Hearing Coordinator
The Hearing Coordinator is a University employee designated to schedule and otherwise coordinate the proceedings of matters related to the Student Conduct Committee.

G. Insufficient Information
Insufficient Information means that the available information is insufficient to support the potential finding of a violation of the UCLA Student Conduct Code based on the preponderance of evidence standard.

H. Notice
Whenever this policy requires giving Notice to any Student, sending such Notice to the electronic or physical mailing address most recently provided by the Student to the Registrar will give rise to a conclusive presumption that Notice has been given as of the date of the mailing.

I. Official University Email Account
The Official University Email Account is the email address that the Student has most recently provided to the UCLA Registrar’s Office.

J. Standard of Proof
The Standard of proof that will be used in hearings is “preponderance of evidence,” i.e., the University must prove that it is more likely than not that the student committed the misconduct of which they are accused.

K. Student
For the purposes of this policy, the term “Student” means an individual for whom the University maintains student records, and who:

is enrolled in or registered with an academic program of the University;
has completed the immediately preceding term and is eligible for re-enrollment, including the recess periods between academic terms; or
Is on an approved educational leave or other approved leave status, including under suspension, or is on filing-fee status.
This policy also applies to the following:

applicants who become students, for offenses committed as part of the application process;
applicants who become students, for offenses committed on campus and/ or while participating in University related events or activities that take place following a student’s submittal of the application through their official enrollment; and
former students for offenses committed while a student.
L. Support Person
A Support Person is any individual accompanying a Student during any stage of the review and resolution process. The Support Person may be any person, including an advocate, attorney, friend, or parent, who is not otherwise a party or witness involved in the review. The Student may be accompanied by a Support Person in addition to an Advisor at any meeting or proceeding that is part of the review and resolution process outlined in this Code. The role of the Support Person is only to provide support. The Support Person is not permitted to speak or otherwise participate in any meeting or proceeding that is part of the review and resolution process and may not in any manner disrupt any such meeting or proceeding.

M. University
The term “University” means the University of California and includes all campuses, the Office of the President, the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and each Department of Energy Laboratory operated by the University.

N. Witness
“Witness” means someone participating in a Student Conduct meeting or proceeding that is a part of the review and resolution process outlined in this Code, either in person, by video, audio, or other forms of electronic communication, or through a written statement prepared for the purposes of the meeting or proceeding.

II. Student Conduct Policies
Students may be held accountable for the types of misconduct set out in Section II.C. The Dean may take action whether or not such misconduct also violates the law, and whether or not proceedings are, have been, or may be brought in the courts involving the same acts. Because of this, students may be involved in University conduct proceedings before, after, or during court proceedings.

Application
The UCLA Student Conduct Code does not apply to student conduct violations involving sexual violence and sexual harassment (including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking of a sexual nature, etc.). All such violations and the applicable student discipline procedures for responding to such conduct are instead addressed by the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment and any local procedures currently in effect. When applicable, relevant provisions of the UCLA Student Conduct Code are referred to directly or incorporated by any local procedures currently in effect to adjudicate student conduct violations that occur in connection with violations of sexual violence and sexual harassment.

Student conduct violations involving sexual violence (including sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking) and sexual harassment are prohibited by the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment as well as the Code. For incidents involving allegations that could constitute conduct prohibited by the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, see the local procedures currently in effect.

A. Jurisdiction
The University has jurisdiction over student conduct that occurs on University property, or in connection with official University programs or functions whether on or off University property. The University may, at its sole discretion, exercise jurisdiction over student behavior that occurs off campus and that would violate student conduct policies or regulations when:

the alleged misconduct indicates the student poses a threat to the safety or security of any individual; or
the alleged misconduct involves academic work or the forgery, alteration or misuse of any University document, record, key, electronic device, or identification.
In determining whether or not to exercise off-campus jurisdiction, the University may consider factors including but not limited to, the seriousness of the alleged misconduct; whether an alleged victim is a member of the campus community; the ability of the University to gather information, including the statements of witnesses; and whether the off-campus conduct is part of a series of actions that occurred both on and off campus.

B. No Contact Directives
A Student may be directed to not intentionally approach, telephone, send anything via campus mail, regular mail, e-mail or text message, or otherwise contact or communicate with another specified individual, including through a third party or social media. These directions will not terminate the Student’s status as a student, and will not be construed as an allegation of misconduct nor a finding of responsibility on the part of any student. However, violation of these directions may be misconduct prohibited by Section 102.16 (Failure to Comply) and Section 102.27 (Unwanted Personal Contact) of the Code.

C. Prohibited Behavior
Students may be held accountable for committing or attempting to commit a violation of this Code or for assisting, facilitating, or participating in the planning of an act that violates this Code (or an act that would be in violation of this Code if it were carried out by a student).

102.01: Academic Dishonesty
All forms of academic misconduct or research misconduct, including, but not limited to, cheating, fabrication or falsification, plagiarism, multiple submissions or facilitating academic misconduct which occurs in academic exercises or submissions.

NOTE : Allegations involving students (paid or unpaid) who were working on externally (including federally) sponsored research projects or supported by externally (including federally) funded research training grants when Research Misconduct involving their supported work was alleged to have occurred, may be afforded a different procedure if the external sponsor requires a process for responding to allegations of Research Misconduct that is similar to, or based on the federal Research Misconduct regulations. In that case, allegations will be managed under UCLA Policy 993 ( Responding to Allegations of Research Misconduct ) and will be forwarded to the Research Integrity Officer (RIO) who will then determine whether an inquiry and/or review is warranted. Should a review be conducted, a copy of the Investigation Committee Report and the RIO’s written determination of whether or not Research Misconduct occurred will be forwarded to the Dean, who may impose one or more sanctions, as appropriate. Otherwise, Section III of this Code is the applicable procedure for responding to allegations of fabrication by students.

In the event that the RIO determines that the research record needs to be corrected due to a finding that Research Misconduct occurred, the campus RIO will initiate a correction or retraction as appropriate.

For the purposes of the UCLA Student Conduct Code, the following definitions apply:

102.01a: Cheating

As described in Section IV.A, before a final determination of alleged misconduct is made, an Interim Suspension or Interim Exclusion may be imposed by the Dean when there is reasonable cause to believe that the Student’s participation in University activities or presence at specified areas of campus will lead to physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on University property or at official University functions, or other disruptive activity incompatible with the orderly operation of the campus.

Incidents involving allegations of sexual violence and sexual harassment (including domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault), are reviewed initially by the Title IX Office pursuant to the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment and any local procedures currently in effect. Where the Title IX Office determines that it does not have jurisdiction over an allegation, the Office of Student Conduct may review the matter to determine if the Code applies.

102.09: Sexual Harassment
Sexual Harassment is defined in the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment. Incidents involving allegations of sexual violence and sexual harassment (including domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault), are reviewed initially by the Title IX Office pursuant to the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment and any local procedures currently in effect. Where the Title IX Office determines that it does not have jurisdiction over an allegation, the Office of Student Conduct may review the matter to determine if the Code applies.

102.10: Stalking
Stalking is behavior in which a Student repeatedly engages in a course of conduct directed at another person and makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for their safety, or the safety of their family, where the threat is reasonably determined by the University to seriously alarm, torment, or terrorize the person, and where the threat is additionally determined by the University to serve no legitimate purpose.

This Code prohibits retaliation against a person who reports stalking, assists someone with a report of stalking; or participates in any manner in an review or resolution of a stalking report. Retaliation includes threats, intimidation, reprisals, and/or adverse actions related to employment or education.

For stalking violations of a sexual nature, see also the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment.

This policy is applicable to any recording in any medium, including handwritten or typed notes.

Any distribution of a recording of a course presentation at UCLA that captures the actual sounds and/or images of that course presentation, in any medium, must consider not only the rights of the instructor and the University, but also those of other parties. Examples include the privacy rights of students enrolled in the course, the rights of guest lecturers, and the copyright interests in materials authored by others that are displayed or presented during the course presentation. In addition to the consent of the University and the instructor/presenter, it may be necessary to secure permission from these other parties before any recording, distribution, publication, or communication is legally permitted.

102.23a: Selling Academic Materials
Selling, preparing, or distributing for any commercial purpose academic materials including, but not limited to, written, video or audio recordings of any course, or course materials, unless authorized by the University in advance and explicitly permitted by the course instructor in writing.

When the conviction also represents a violation of section(s) 102.08, 102.09 and/or 102.10 involving sexual harassment and sexual violence (including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking), the Title IX Office will review the matter pursuant to the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, any related Appendices and any local procedures currently in effect. Where the Title IX Office determines that it does not have jurisdiction over an allegation, the Office of Student Conduct may review the incident(s) to determine if the Code applies.

102.26: Terrorizing Conduct
Conduct, where the actor means to communicate a serious expression of intent to terrorize, or acts in reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing, one or more University students, faculty, or staff.

Terrorize means to cause a reasonable person to fear bodily harm or death, perpetrated by the actor(s) or those acting under their control.

Reckless disregard means consciously disregarding a substantial risk.

This section applies without regard to whether the conduct is motivated by race, ethnicity, personal animosity or other reasons. This section does not apply to conduct that constitutes the lawful defense of oneself, of another, or of property.

102.27: Unwanted Personal Contact
Contact (whether physical, verbal, written, face-to-face, telephonic, electronic, or by other means) that:

A student knows or should know is unwanted;
Is communicated directly to one or more specific student(s), Student Group(s), faculty, or staff;
Constitutes severe and/or pervasive, and objectively offensive, conduct; and
Does not constitute speech protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (e.g., speech in a public forum on a matter of public concern).
102.28: Expectation of Privacy
The following is prohibited:

Making a video recording, audio recording, taking one or more photographs, or streaming audio/video of any person in a location where the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy, without that person’s knowledge and express consent, or posting online any audio/video/photograph made by another individual of any person in a location where the person had a reasonable expectation of privacy, without that person’s knowledge and express consent.
Making a video recording, audio recording, or streaming audio/video of private, non-public conversations and/or meetings, without the knowledge and express consent of all recorded parties, or posting online any audio/video/photographs made by another individual of any private, non-public conversations and/or meetings, without the knowledge and express consent of all recorded parties.
Looking through a hole or opening, into, or otherwise viewing, by means of any instrumentality, the interior of a private location without the subject’s knowledge and express consent.
“Express consent” is clear, unmistakable and voluntary consent that may be in written, oral or nonverbal form.

“Private locations” are settings where the person reasonably expected privacy. For example, in most cases the following are considered private locations: residential living quarters, bathrooms, locker rooms, and personal offices.

“Private, non-public conversations and/or meetings” include any communication carried on in circumstances that reasonably indicate that any party wants the communication to be confined to the parties, but excludes a communication made in a public gathering, or in any other circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded.

These provisions do not extend to public events or discussions, nor to lawful official law or policy enforcement activities. These provisions may not be utilized to impinge upon the lawful exercise of constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech or assembly.

For incidents involving allegations of conduct prohibited by the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (including Invasions of Sexual Privacy), the Title IX Office will review the matter pursuant to this Policy, any related Appendices and any local procedures currently in effect. Where the Title IX Office determines that it does not have jurisdiction over an allegation, the Office of Student Conduct may review the incident(s) to determine if the Code applies.

102.29 Violation of the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment
III. Student Conduct Procedures
The University strives to be fair in the management of student conduct cases. The Chancellor has established these procedures and published the UCLA Student Conduct Code, providing for the management of student conduct cases. The procedures outlined in this section represent the steps employed to reach a resolution in cases of alleged misconduct.

For incidents involving allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence (including domestic violence, dating violence and sexual assault), see the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment and any local procedures currently in effect.

Questions concerning these procedures may be addressed to the Office of Student Conduct, or to Student Legal Services.

Complaints involving alleged misconduct by students must be submitted in writing to the Office of Student Conduct, except those in which the Student is subject to an approved disciplinary procedure of a School, College, or other University unit. Complaints falling within the above exception may also be referred to the Office of Student Conduct if such referral is provided for in the approved disciplinary procedure of the School, College, or other University unit.

Time Limitations:
For allegations of conduct prohibited by the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, referrals may be made to the Office of Student Conduct at any time provided the individual referred meets the definition of Student. For all other allegations of misconduct, referrals to the Office of Student Conduct must be made within one year following discovery of the alleged misconduct, unless an exception is granted by the Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs (VCSA) or designee.

The Dean may provide information about other campus or community resources which may be of assistance to the Student (e.g., Counseling and Psychological Services, the UCLA Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center, Student Legal Services).

A. Initial Review
Upon receiving a report regarding alleged violation(s), the Dean will consider information acquired from the reporting party and may conduct further review to augment that information. If the Dean determines that there is sufficient information to proceed with the conduct process, the Dean will give written Notice to the Student of the alleged violation(s).

If the Dean determines that there is not sufficient information to proceed with the Student conduct process, the Dean may give written Notice to the Student directing the Student not to intentionally approach, telephone, send anything via campus mail, regular mail, e-mail or text message, or otherwise contact or communicate with another specified individual, including through a third party or social media. These directions will not terminate the Student’s status as a student, and will not be construed as an allegation of misconduct nor a finding of responsibility on the part of any student. Violation of these directions may be a violation of Section 102.16 (Failure to Comply), Section 102.27 (Unwanted Personal Contact) and/or other applicable sections of the UCLA Student Conduct Code.

B. Notice to Student
Notice to Student shall include the following:

The nature of the conduct in question and the basis for the allegation, including a brief statement of the basis of the charges, the date or period of time and the location of the alleged incident;
The University policy(ies) and/or campus regulation(s) allegedly violated; and information on how to access a full version of the UCLA Student Conduct Code ;
That the Student has five Days from the date Notice was given to contact the Office of Student Conduct for the purpose of scheduling an initial meeting;
That if the Student does not contact the Office of Student Conduct within the five-day period, or fails to keep any scheduled appointment, a Hold may be placed on the Student’s University records and the Student will be notified that this action has been taken. The placement of a Hold on the Student’s University records may, for example, prevent the Student from registering and from obtaining transcripts, verifications, or a degree from the University. The Hold will be removed only when the Student either attends a scheduled meeting at the Office of Student Conduct, or requests in writing that the case be referred to the Student Conduct Committee for a hearing; and
That no degree may be conferred on a Student until all allegations against a Student and any assigned sanctions and conditions have been fully resolved. The Dean may place a Hold on that Student’s University records to prevent the Student from receiving a degree or diploma.
In addition, the Dean may include language directing the Student to act or refrain from acting in a manner specified by the Dean. These directions may include directing the Student not to intentionally approach, telephone, send anything via campus mail, regular mail, e-mail or text message, or otherwise contact or communicate with another specified individual, including through a third party or social media until the matter is resolved. These directions will not terminate the Student’s status as a student, and will not be construed as an allegation of misconduct nor a finding of responsibility on the part of any student. Violation of these directions may be a violation of Section 102.16 (Failure to Comply), Section 102.27 (Unwanted Personal Contact) and/or other applicable sections of the UCLA Student Conduct Code.

In cases involving an active police investigation, if the Dean, in conjunction with the University of California Police Department (UCPD), determines that Notice to the Student may interfere with the criminal investigation, the Dean may delay Notice to the Student for a reasonable period of time, for example when the investigation involves the safety of a member of the campus community.

C. Meeting(s) with the Dean
Meeting with the Dean provides the Student an opportunity to resolve the matter. At the initial meeting with the Student, the Dean will:

ensure that the Student has been provided information on how to access the UCLA Student Conduct Code ;
discuss confidentiality; inform the Student that the content of this and all subsequent communication with the Office regarding information not relevant to the case will, insofar as allowed by law, be treated confidentially, unless such confidentiality is waived by the Student; and that information relevant to the case may be divulged to those who have a legitimate educational interest, including but not limited to the Student Conduct Committee;
describe to the Student the nature of the conduct in question, and the University policy(s) and/or campus regulation(s) allegedly violated, hear the Student’s response to such allegations, and counsel the Student as appropriate; and
provide the Student with information about the right to inspect all documents relevant to the case which are in the possession of the Office of Student Conduct; (Note: all documents will be redacted to comply with state and federal laws and regulations and University policies.)
If a student believes that a reasonable accommodation is required to assist them in meeting with the Dean, the student must contact and register with the Center for Accessible Education (CAE). CAE will provide the Dean with recommended accommodations. The Dean will either provide the recommended accommodation or work directly with CAE to discuss alternatives to the recommended accommodation.

At the Dean’s discretion, another staff member may be present in the meeting to provide administrative or procedural support. The assigned dean will remain the primary point of contact for the Student.

D. Decisions in Absentia
If a Student fails to participate in the disciplinary process, or has withdrawn from the University while subject to pending disciplinary action, the Dean may move forward to resolve the matter without the Student’s participation.

E. Resolution by the Dean
At the conclusion of the review, the Dean may take one of several actions listed below. In cases of alleged physical assault, the alleged victim will receive written notification of the outcome of any disciplinary action or Agreement of Resolution by the University.

1. Letter of Admonition
The Dean may provide Notice to a Student that the alleged behavior may have violated University policy or campus regulations and that, if repeated, such behavior may be subject to the disciplinary process.

2. Imposing Sanctions
If the Student acknowledges behavior that is prohibited by the UCLA Student Conduct Code, the Dean may impose one or more of the sanctions listed in Section III.G.

3. Referral to the Student Conduct Committee
A case is referred to the Student Conduct Committee for a hearing when the Student does not acknowledge engaging in behavior prohibited by the UCLA Student Conduct Code, but the Dean concludes from the available information that the Student Conduct Committee may find that it is more likely than not that a violation of the UCLA Student Conduct Code has occurred.

At any time before the student conduct hearing occurs, if the Dean receives new information that leads the Dean to the conclusion that that a violation of the Code has not occurred, then the Dean may withdraw the case from the Student Conduct Committee. This disposition is binding and terminates that Student Conduct Committee proceeding.

4. Insufficient Information
If the Dean concludes there is insufficient information on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence to issue a finding of responsibility for the alleged violation(s), then the matter will be closed with no further action taken.

5. Agreement of Resolution
When the Dean and the Student agree that the above dispositions are not appropriate, an Agreement of Resolution may be used to conclude the matter.

This Resolution, while not considered to be a finding of responsibility, is binding. If the Student fails to abide by the terms of the Agreement of Resolution, that failure may be regarded as actionable misconduct and may subject the Student to disciplinary action by the University.

An Agreement of Resolution may include such terms as:

agreement by the Student to refrain from specific behaviors, and/or to refrain from contacting others involved in the case;
agreement by the Student to participate in specified educational programs and/or reconciliation processes such as mediation; and/or
agreement by the Student to participate in specified community service activities.
The Agreement of Resolution is not a formal disciplinary action but will be retained in the case file in the Office of Student Conduct in compliance with Section V. During that time, should the Dean have a reasonable basis to believe that the Student has engaged in misconduct related in nature to the conduct which occasioned the Agreement, both cases may be the subject of University disciplinary action.

F. Amnesty
Complainants and witnesses, who are students, and who participate in a review of sexual violence, will not be subject to disciplinary sanctions for a violation of the University’s student conduct policy at or near the time of the incident, unless the institution determines that the violation was egregious, including, but not limited to, an action that places the health or safety of any other person at risk or involves plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty. See the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment and any local procedures currently in effect.

G. Sanctions and Additional University Actions
When it is determined that a Student’s behavior is in violation of University policy(ies), the Dean will consider the context and seriousness of the violation in determining the appropriate sanction(s).

In addition to the sanctions listed below in G.1–7, the Dean may also impose additional conditions, included but not limited to, one or more of the following conditions:

Exclusion from Areas of the Campus or from Official University Functions
Loss of Privileges and Exclusion from Activities
Community Service
Restitution
Participation in designated educational programs, services, or activities
Letter of Apology
Participation in a Restorative Justice conference
Housing Exclusion
Withholding of diploma or awarding of degree otherwise earned until the completion of all sanctions and conditions imposed by the Dean.
Failure to comply with the above conditions imposed by the Dean may subject the Student to additional disciplinary action including, but not limited to, suspension and dismissal. In addition, a Hold may be placed on the Student’s University records for either a stated period or until the Student satisfies the conditions imposed as part of a sanction. The placement of a Hold on the Student’s University records may prevent the Student from registering; and from obtaining transcripts, University services, or a diploma; and prevent the awarding of a degree from the University.

Sanctions (for any violations of Section II.C, Prohibited Behavior) may be increased where an individual was selected because of the individual’s race, color, national or ethnic origin, citizenship, sex, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, marital status, ancestry, service in the uniformed services, physical or mental disability, medical condition, or perceived membership in any of these classifications.

1. Warning
Notice or reprimand to the Student that a violation of specified University policies or campus regulations has occurred and that further violations of the UCLA Student Conduct Code or failure to complete any assigned condition(s) may result in additional disciplinary action including, but not limited to, suspension or dismissal.

2. Disciplinary Probation
A status imposed for a specific period of time in which a Student must demonstrate conduct that conforms to University standards of conduct. Conditions restricting the Student’s privileges or eligibility for activities may be imposed. Further violations of the UCLA Student Conduct Code, or failure to complete any assigned conditions may result in additional disciplinary action including, but not limited to, suspension or dismissal.

3. Deferred Suspension
A status imposed for a specific period of time in which the Student must successfully complete conditions outlined by the Dean. Further violations of the UCLA Student Conduct Code or failure to complete any assigned conditions may result in additional disciplinary action including, but not limited to, suspension or dismissal. A student on Deferred Suspension is considered not in good conduct standing for the duration of the Deferred Suspension period.

4. Deferred Dismissal
A status imposed for a specific period of time in which the Student must successfully complete conditions outlined by the Dean. Further violations of the UCLA Student Conduct Cod e or failure to complete any assigned conditions will result in additional disciplinary action including but not limited to suspension or dismissal. A student on Deferred Dismissal is considered not in good conduct standing for the duration of the Deferred Dismissal period.

5. Suspension
Suspension is the termination of UCLA student status for a specified academic term or terms, to take effect at such time as the Dean or the VCSA or designee determines. A suspended student will be ineligible to enroll in UCLA Extension concurrent courses during the period of suspension. During the period of suspension, the Dean may place a Hold on the Student’s University records which may prevent the Student from registering and from obtaining transcripts, verifications, or a degree from the University. Suspension may include a prohibition against entering specified areas of the campus. Further violations of the Code or failure to complete any assigned conditions may result in additional disciplinary action including, but not limited, to additional suspension, or dismissal. A student on Suspension is considered not in good conduct standing for the duration of the Suspension period. A student may not transfer or register for courses at another campus or location of the University of California during the period of Suspension.

After the period of Suspension, the Student will be reinstated if:

a. The Student has complied with all conditions imposed as part of the Suspension;

b. The Student is academically eligible;

c. The Student meets all requirements for reinstatement including, but not limited to, removal of Holds on records, and payment of restitution where payment is a requirement of reinstatement; and

d. The Student meets the deadlines for filing all necessary applications, including those for readmission, registration, and enrollment.

e. Graduate and professional students are required to apply for readmission following a suspension, and must meet all requirements for readmission.

No Suspension from the University will become official until five Days from the date of Notice of the Dean’s disposition or the completion of a Student’s appeal.

6. Dismissal
Dismissal is the termination of University of California student status for an indefinite period and may include an exclusion from specified areas of the campus.

Readmission to any campus of the University of California after Dismissal may be granted only under exceptional circumstances and requires the specific approval of the Chancellor of the campus to which a dismissed Student has applied.

No Dismissal from the University will become official until five Days from the date of Notice of the Dean’s disposition or the completion of a Student’s appeal. A student on Dismissal is considered not in good conduct standing for the duration of the Dismissal period.

7. Revocation of Awarding of Degree
If, after a degree has been awarded, a degree recipient is found responsible for a violation of the UCLA Student Conduct Code involving academic dishonesty or fraud committed while a Student, then the Dean of Students* may impose, as a sanction, a revocation of the degree, subject to the following procedures:

The Dean of Students will submit a recommendation of revocation of the degree to the Academic Senate and obtain the concurrence of the Chair of the Academic Senate.
If the degree in question is a graduate/professional degree, the Dean of Students will also submit a recommendation of revocation of the degree to the Dean of the Graduate Division and cognizant academic or Professional School Dean and obtain the concurrence of those Deans.
If the degree in question is an undergraduate degree, the Dean of Students will also submit a recommendation of revocation of the degree to the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education and the cognizant Academic or Professional School Dean and obtain the concurrence of those Deans.
A Notice of Intent to Revoke Degree shall be sent to the Student. This Notice shall include the details of the violation and the basis for the revocation.
The Student may submit a written appeal of the revocation to the VCSA or designee within twenty Days from the date of the Notice of Intent to Revoke Degree. The imposition of the Revocation of Degree will be deferred during such appeal. The review of such appeal will be in accordance with the procedure specified in Section III.K of the Code. The appeal may be sent from the Student’s official University email address, or may be submitted in writing to the Campus Hearing Coordinator, signed by the Student. If the Student does not appeal within twenty Days, the revocation of the degree is final.
If the VCSA or designee upholds the revocation of degree, the Student may submit a written appeal to the Chancellor within twenty Days from the date of Notice of the VCSA or designee’s decision. The decision of the Chancellor is final.
*For degrees issued by the David Geffen School of Medicine, authority to revoke degrees is the responsibility of the David Geffen School of Medicine Dean of Students.

H. Limits on Sanctions
The loss of University employment will not be a form of sanction under the UCLA Student Conduct Code. However, when student status is a condition of employment, the loss of student status will result in termination of the Student’s employment. This section is not intended to preclude the disclosure to other appropriate University officials of information relating to any student’s conduct records if that information may be reasonably construed to have bearing on the Student’s suitability for a specific employment situation. This section is also not intended to preclude an employer from terminating a student’s employment outside the disciplinary process.

In imposing sanctions other than Suspension or Dismissal, access to housing and health services will not be restricted unless the nature of the act that occasioned the sanction is appropriately related to the restriction.

I. Posting of Suspension or Dismissal on Academic Transcript
When, as a result of violations of the UCLA Student Conduct Code, a student is suspended or dismissed, the fact that the sanction was imposed must be posted on the academic transcript for the duration of the Suspension or Dismissal.

J. Appeal of the Sanction
If the Dean imposes a sanction of Deferred Suspension, Deferred Dismissal, Suspension, or Dismissal, the Student may appeal the sanction, to the VCSA or designee, on the grounds that the sanction assigned is substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation. All appeals must clearly articulate and support the grounds for appeal. Appeals must be received within five Days of the date of Notice from the Dean of the individual’s action. Appeals may be submitted directly to the VCSA or designee by e-mail, sent from the Student’s Official University Email Account, or may be submitted in writing to the Campus Hearing Coordinator, signed by the Student. The imposition of a sanction of Suspension or Dismissal will be deferred during such appeal.

The VCSA or designee is not limited to those sanctions imposed by the Dean and may impose any one or more of the sanctions listed in Section III.G above, even though such decision may result in the imposition of more or less severe disciplinary action.

The VCSA or designee will have ten Days after the receipt of the appeal to deliver a written decision unless an extension is granted. The decision of the Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs is final. A letter containing the decision will be delivered to the Student and to the Dean. In cases of alleged physical assault, notice of outcome including the decision will also be delivered to the alleged victim.

K. The Student Conduct Committee
When a case is referred to the Student Conduct Committee, the following will be provided to the Student to ensure a fair hearing where the University shall bear the burden of proof:

The Student will be provided written Notice within a reasonable time before the hearing; this Notice will include a brief statement of the basis of the charges, the University policy(s) or campus regulations allegedly violated, and the time and place of the hearing.
The Student will be provided the opportunity for a prompt hearing.
The Student will be given the opportunity to present documents and to propose questions to be asked in person, by video, audio, or other forms of electronic communication, or in writing, of any witnesses presented by the University.
The Hearing Committee will evaluate information presented in the hearing to determine if it is more likely or not that the Student has violated the Code.
Within ten Days following the conclusion of the hearing, the Student will receive a written report including a summary of the findings of fact.
Following the issuance of the decision, the Student will be provided an opportunity to appeal. At the request of the Student, to assist in the preparation of an appeal, post-hearing access will be granted for the Student to review, but not copy, the hearing recording. This access will be provided on the University campus, during regular business hours; the recording may not be removed from the premises or reproduced. The accused Student may be accompanied by the Advisor and/or Support Person(s) who accompanied the Student at the hearing. When the student is unable to be present on the University campus during regular business hours, the Student will be provided with reasonable alternative access which may include access to review the recording either on campus on Saturdays, Sundays, or days on which the campus is closed, or an alternate location during regular business hours.
1. Referral of Cases to the Student Conduct Committee
A hearing will be provided for all cases referred to the Student Conduct Committee under the Code, unless prior to the hearing, either:
The Student makes an admission of responsibility to the Dean, or
The Dean receives new information that leads The Dean to the conclusion that a violation of the UCLA Student Conduct Code has not occurred.

3. Training of the Student Conduct Committee
The Office of Student Conduct is responsible for providing all Student Conduct Committee members with orientation and training on University Policies (including the UCLA Student Conduct Code ) and on how to conduct a hearing in a way that protects the safety of all participants, promotes accountability, and assures a fair, unbiased hearing for the accused Student.

4. Assignment of Student Conduct Committee Panel Members
A panel will consist of at least three but no more than five members of the Student Conduct Committee, one of whom must be a Chair. The accused Student may, for good cause, challenge the assignment of any particular committee member. The Hearing Coordinator will adjudicate all challenges to committee members.

5. Scheduling of Hearing
It is the intention of the Code that hearings be set as soon as reasonably possible after referral to the Student Conduct Committee.

The Hearing Coordinator will schedule a hearing of the case to be conducted no sooner than five Days after the date of Notice that the case was being referred to the Student Conduct Committee. Hearings are typically held on University business days. Hearings may be held on Saturdays, Sundays, or days on which the campus is closed, with mutual consent.

The Hearing Coordinator will give Notice of the time and place of the hearing and other relevant hearing information to the accused Student at least five Days prior to the date of the hearing.

The Dean and the accused Student must provide the Hearing Coordinator with relevant material, including the identities of all witnesses as well as copies of any documents which the parties intend to produce at the hearing at least three Days prior to the hearing. To the extent feasible, the Hearing Coordinator will make any materials available to the other parties in the matter two Days prior to the hearing. Any witnesses or materials not submitted to the Hearing Coordinator at least three Days prior to the hearing may be introduced in the hearing at the discretion of the Student Conduct Committee Chair.

6. Hearing Procedures
The accused Student will have the opportunity to present documents and witnesses, and to address all information being presented in the hearing. Specifically, the accused Student will have the opportunity to propose questions to be asked of witnesses who appear at the hearing in person, or by telephone or other electronic means, and to propose questions to be asked about documents and written statements presented in the hearing.

The accused Student may challenge the admission of any documents or written statements on the grounds that those documents or statements are unduly prejudicial. The Student Conduct Committee Chair will determine the appropriateness of all questions and the order of questioning. Whenever possible, the chair will ask questions as they are submitted by the Student and will not rephrase or change them unless the questions posed are inflammatory or intended to harass or intimidate a witness. The Chair may, however, exclude questions that are unduly repetitive, clearly not relevant, or unduly time consuming or inappropriate. The Student Conduct Committee Chair will determine the admissibility of documents and written statements.

The accused Student is responsible for presenting their information and may choose to be assisted by an Advisor of their own choosing.

Options for assistance may be discussed with the Dean, the Hearing Coordinator, or Student Legal Services. A small pool of trained volunteers is available to assist students, at no cost, with their preparation for the hearing. A student may request to be assisted by one of these volunteer Advisors by submitting a request to the Hearing Coordinator.

If the accused Student does not speak in the hearing, no inferences can be drawn as a direct result of that silence.

The Student Conduct Committee Chair is responsible for the secure and orderly operation and administration of the hearing, and has the right to exclude persons from the hearing room if deemed necessary. All procedural questions are subject to the final decision of the Student Conduct Committee Chair.

Students with a qualified disability who believe they will require a reasonable accommodation in the hearing must contact and register with the Center for Accessible Education (CAE). CAE will provide the Hearing Coordinator with recommended accommodations. The Hearing Coordinator will either provide the recommended accommodations or work directly with CAE to discuss alternatives to the recommended accommodations.

At the Hearing Coordinator’s discretion, another staff member may be present in the meeting to provide administrative or procedural support. The Hearing Coordinator will remain the primary point of contact for the Student.

7. Hearings in Absentia
If a Student does not attend the hearing, the case may proceed to disposition without the Student’s participation.

For hearings involving alleged sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking, please see the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, any related Appendices and any local procedures currently in effect.

8. Standard of Proof
The Standard of Proof which will be used in hearings is that the University must prove that it is more likely than not that the student committed the misconduct of which the student is accused of. The Student Conduct Committee will deliberate in private and reach a decision based upon this standard. The Committee shall attempt to reach a unanimous decision, but the majority shall make the decision if the Committee cannot reach a unanimous decision.

9. Record of Hearing
The Hearing Administrator will make a single verbatim recording, such as a tape recording, of the hearing. (Deliberations shall not be recorded). This recording shall be the property of the University and will be maintained by the Hearing Coordinator as long as the Office of Student Conduct maintains the student discipline records (see Section V, Privacy and Records Retention).

The documents submitted by the parties and accepted by the Student Conduct Committee Chair will constitute the official record of the hearing, and will become part of the Student’s conduct record.

10. Spectators
To protect the privacy of persons participating in the student conduct process, the hearing will be closed to spectators, including witnesses. Witnesses may only be present in the hearing when answering questions from the Student Conduct Committee.

However, the accused Student will be entitled, for support, to have up to two Support Persons of their choice accompany them to the hearing, in addition to the Advisor. A Support Person may not be called as a witness. The Student Conduct Committee Chair has the right to exclude Support Persons from the hearing room if deemed necessary for the secure or orderly conduct of the hearing.

11. Continuing Resolution Between the Student and the Dean
Until the Student Conduct Committee makes its report to the Dean of Students, the accused Student may make an admission of responsibility to the Dean assigned to the case. This disposition of the matter will bind all parties and terminate all proceedings.

12. Student Conduct Committee’s Report and Recommendations from the Office of Student Conduct
At the conclusion of a hearing, the Student Conduct Committee Chair will provide the Hearing Administrator with:

a. A summary of the allegations;

b. A summary of the information presented;

c. Whether, in the opinion of a majority of the Student Conduct Committee Panel, the accused Student has violated one or more of the University policies or campus regulations the accused Student has been charged with violating, or whether there has been Insufficient Information to sustain such a finding and the basis for that opinion; and

The Hearing Administrator will prepare a report to be provided to the Dean of Students which includes this information. This report will also include the recommended sanctions from the assigned Dean in cases where the Student Conduct Committee concludes that the accused Student has violated the Code. The assigned Dean will not recommend sanctions in cases where the Student Conduct Committees concludes that there is Insufficient Information that a violation occurred.

13. Decision by the Dean of Students or Designee
The decision regarding a case that has been heard by the Student Conduct Committee will be made by the Dean of Students or designee.

a. Basis for Decision
The Dean of Students or designee shall base their decision upon the report submitted by the Hearing Administrator including the findings of the Student Conduct Committee and any recommended sanctions provided by the assigned Dean in cases where the Student Conduct Committee concludes that the accused Student has violated the Code. Counsel may be solicited from the assigned Dean regarding sanctions imposed in similar cases and previous cases of misconduct by the Student on file with the Office of Student Conduct.

b. Notice of Decision
The Dean of Students will provide the Student and the assigned Dean with a copy of the hearing report and the Dean of Students’ written decision not later than 12 Days after the conclusion of the hearing unless an extension is granted. In cases of alleged physical assault, the alleged victim of physical assault will receive written notification of the outcome of any disciplinary action or Agreement of Resolution by the University.

The Dean of Students may also notify other parties of their decision, or may direct the assigned Dean to do so, if there is an institutional interest in doing so, and if such parties are authorized to receive such information under the provisions of the University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students.

14. Appeal by the Accused Student
The accused Student will have five Days from the date of the letter of the Dean of Students’ written notice of decision, unless an extension is granted, in which the Student may submit a written appeal to the VCSA or designee, challenging the Dean of Students’ decision.

All appeals must clearly articulate and support the grounds for appeal. Appeal responses may be submitted by e-mail from the accused Student’s Official University Email Account, or may be submitted in writing, to the Campus Hearing Coordinator, signed by the Student.

The three grounds on which a Student may appeal are:

a. The hearing was not conducted in accordance with the UCLA Student Conduct Code or the UC Policy. Deviations from designated procedures will not be a basis for sustaining a challenge unless the procedural error substantially impacted the finding or sanction.

b. There is new information, or other relevant facts, potentially sufficient to alter the findings, but that could not have been known to the Student at the time of the hearing.

c. The sanction(s) imposed are substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation of the UCLA Student Conduct Code which the Student was found to have committed.

At the request of the Student, to assist in the preparation of an appeal, post-hearing access will be granted for the Student to review, but not copy, the hearing recording. Students must contact the Hearing Coordinator or designee prior to the date on which their appeal is due to schedule a meeting to review the recording. While reviewing the recording, students may be accompanied by the Advisor and/or Support Persons who accompanied them at the hearing.

L. Decision by the Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs or designee
The VCSA or designee will have 15 Days after the receipt of the appeal to deliver their written decision unless an extension is granted.

1. Basis for Decision
The VCSA or designee shall base their decision upon:

a. The report submitted by the Hearing Administrator including the findings of the Student Conduct Committee and any recommended sanctions provided by the assigned Dean;

b. Counsel solicited from the assigned Dean regarding sanctions imposed in similar cases and previous cases of misconduct by the Student on file with the Office of Student Conduct; and

c. The content of any written appeal submitted by the accused Student.

2. Sanctions or Other Actions
The VCSA or designee may decide to impose one or more of the sanctions listed in Section III.G. The VCSA or designee is not limited to those sanctions recommended by the assigned Dean or those sanctions imposed by the Dean of Students. That decision may result in the imposition of more or less severe disciplinary action than imposed by the Dean of Students.

When an appeal is based on new information or other relevant facts that could not have been known to the accused Student at the time of the hearing, and which are deemed sufficient to alter a decision is successful, the VCSA or designee may opt to send the case back to the Student Conduct Committee to be reheard.

3. Notice of Decision
Written notice of the VCSA or designee’s decision will be issued to the Student and to the Dean. In cases of alleged physical assault, the alleged victim will receive written notification of the outcome of any disciplinary action or Agreement of Resolution by the University. The VCSA or designee may also notify other parties of the decision, or may direct the Dean to do so, if there is an institutional interest in doing so, and if such parties are authorized to receive such information under the provisions of the University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students.

The decision of the VCSA or designee is final.

IV. Interim and Emergency Measures
A. Interim Suspension
Before final determination of alleged misconduct, an Interim Suspension may be imposed by the Dean. Interim Suspension, as defined in Section 105.08 of the University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, may include exclusion from classes or from other specified activities or areas of the campus.

A student will be restricted only to the minimum extent necessary when there is reasonable cause to believe that the student’s participation in University activities or presence at specified areas of the campus will lead to physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on University property or at official University functions, or other disruptive activity incompatible with the orderly operation of the campus.

1. Not more than twenty-four hours after the imposition of the Interim Suspension, the Chancellor or designee will review the information upon which the Interim Suspension was based If the Chancellor or designee does not affirm the Interim Suspension within twenty-four hours of its imposition, the Interim Suspension will be deemed void and a reasonable effort will be made to inform the Student who was suspended that the Interim Suspension is void. Should the Interim Suspension be voided, that will have no bearing on University disciplinary proceedings arising from the conduct which gave rise to the imposition of the Interim Suspension. Any such disciplinary proceedings will be conducted under the normal procedures provided by the UCLA Student Conduct Code. For violations involving sexual harassment and sexual violence, disciplinary proceedings will be conducted pursuant to the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, any related Appendices and any local procedures currently in effect.

2. Upon imposition of the Interim Suspension, the Dean will notify the Student under the Interim Suspension of the charges against the Student, the length and conditions of the Interim Suspension, and the opportunity for a hearing with the Dean of Students, or designee, to challenge the Interim Suspension.

3. Hearings to review Interim Suspensions will have scheduling priority. The Student may be assisted at the hearing by a Support Person of the Student’s choosing and at the Student’s expense. The Student may present information in support of the contention that the Interim Suspension is unnecessary or that its conditions should be modified. The Dean of Students or designee is authorized to investigate the facts which gave rise to the Interim Suspension and may lift the Interim Suspension or modify its conditions. Within three Days of the conclusion of the hearing, the Dean of Students or designee will determine:

a. if the Interim Suspension is necessary; and

b. if its conditions should be modified.

The result of this hearing will have no bearing on other University disciplinary proceedings arising from the conduct which gave rise to the Interim Suspension.

Any such disciplinary proceedings may be conducted under the normal procedures provided in the UCLA Student Conduct Code. For violations involving sexual harassment and sexual violence, disciplinary proceedings will be conducted pursuant to the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, any related Appendices and any local procedures currently in effect.

B. Interim Exclusion
Before final determination of alleged misconduct, Interim Exclusion may be imposed by the Dean. Interim Exclusion, as defined in Section 105.08 of the University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, may include exclusion from classes or from other specified activities or areas of the campus. A student will be restricted only to the minimum extent necessary when there is reasonable cause to believe that the student’s participation in University activities or presence at specified areas of the campus will lead to physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on University property or at official University functions, or other disruptive activity incompatible with the orderly operation of the campus.

1. Not more than twenty-four hours after the imposition of the Interim Suspension, the Chancellor or designee will review the information upon which the Interim Suspension was based. If the Chancellor or designee does not affirm the Interim Exclusion within twenty-four hours of its imposition, the Interim Exclusion will be deemed void and a reasonable effort will be made to inform the Student who was excluded that the Interim Exclusion is void. Should the Interim Exclusion be voided, that will have no bearing on University disciplinary proceedings arising from the conduct which gave rise to the Interim Exclusion. Any such disciplinary proceedings will be conducted under the normal procedures provided by this policy.

2. For violations involving sexual harassment and sexual violence, disciplinary proceedings will be conducted pursuant to the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, any related Appendices and any local procedures currently in effect.

3. Upon imposition of the Interim Exclusion, the Dean will notify the Student under the Interim Exclusion of the charges against the Student, the length and conditions of the Interim Exclusion, and the opportunity for a hearing with the Dean of Students, or designee to challenge the Interim Exclusion.

4. Hearings to review Interim Suspensions will have scheduling priority. The Student may be assisted at the hearing by a Support Person of the Student’s choosing and at the Student’s expense. The Student may present information in support of the contention that the Interim Suspension is unnecessary or that its conditions should be modified. The Dean of Students, or designee is authorized to investigate the facts which gave rise to the Interim Exclusion and may lift the Interim Exclusion or modify its conditions. Within three Days of the conclusion of the hearing, the Dean of Students, or designee will determine

a) if the Interim Exclusion is necessary; and

b) if its conditions should be modified.

The result of this hearing will have no bearing on other University disciplinary proceedings arising from the conduct which gave rise to the Interim Suspension. Any such disciplinary proceedings will be conducted under the normal procedures provided in this policy. For violations involving sexual harassment and sexual violence, disciplinary proceedings will be conducted pursuant to the University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, any related Appendices and any local procedures currently in effect.

C. Emergency Suspension
During a state of emergency, the Chancellor or a designated representative may impose Emergency Suspension on a student as described in Section 53.00 of the University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students when there is reasonable cause to believe:

1. The individual has participated in a disturbance of the peace or unlawful assembly, or has acted in violation of the campus emergency orders, has committed an act of physical violence, or has threatened to commit such an act, or has committed a theft or has damaged property; or.

2. The individual’s presence on campus will lead to violation of campus emergency orders, violence, intimidation, damage to property, or other disruptive activity incompatible with the orderly operation of the campus.

If Emergency Suspension is imposed by a designated representative of the Chancellor, such representative will immediately inform the Chancellor and will submit a written report on the action to the Chancellor as soon as it is reasonably possible. The report will contain a description of the person suspended, including the person’s name and, if available, address and telephone number, and a statement of the facts giving rise to the Suspension. If the Chancellor does not affirm the action of the designated representative within twenty-four hours after being informed that the Emergency Suspension has been imposed, the Emergency Suspension will be deemed void and a reasonable effort will be made to inform the person who was suspended that the Emergency Suspension is void.

a. Any Student placed on Emergency Suspension will be given Notice of Emergency Suspension, either by delivering it to the individual personally, by mailing it to the individual’s last known address of record, or by sending it to their Official University Email Account. The Notice of Emergency Suspension will inform the individual of the procedures by which the validity of the Emergency Suspension can be appealed, including the opportunity to obtain a special hearing on the Emergency Suspension. If an individual is found to have been unjustifiably placed on Emergency Suspension, the University is committed to a policy whereby reasonable efforts are taken to assist such an individual who has been disadvantaged in employment or academic status.

b. Any Student placed on Emergency Suspension will not, during the period of Emergency Suspension, enter upon specified areas of the campus or engage in specified activities, as set forth in the Notice of Emergency Suspension.

The exclusion or restriction will be limited to the minimum extent necessary to protect the health and safety of persons or property, or to maintain the orderly operation of the campus.

c. The outcome of the appeal will have no bearing on University disciplinary proceedings arising from the conduct which gave rise to the Emergency Suspension.

d. Violation of any condition set forth in the Notice of Emergency Suspension will subject the individual to disciplinary proceedings based upon such violation.

V. Privacy and Records Retention
Student conduct records are confidential. The disclosure of information from such records is subject to section 130.00 of the University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations and Students, UCLA Policy 220 – Disclosure of Information From Student Records to the California Information Practices Act, and to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

In cases where the final disposition is Dismissal or Revocation of Degree, the Office of Student Conduct retains student conduct records for fifty years from the end of the fiscal year in which the Notice of final disposition was issued.

For cases that do not result in dismissal but which are required to be included in the UCLA Jeanne Clery Crime Statistics Report, the Office of Student Conduct retains student conduct records for seven years from the end of the academic year in which the Notice of final disposition was issued, provided there are no incomplete sanctions or conditions; no student conduct records will be destroyed while there are outstanding holds, sanctions or conditions, or when the matter is pending or on hold. Student conduct records in all other cases are retained for five years from the end of the academic year in which the Notice of final disposition was issued, provided there are no incomplete sanctions or conditions; no student conduct records will be destroyed while there are outstanding holds, sanctions or conditions, or when a matter is pending or on hold. When there have been repeated violations of the UCLA Student Conduct Code, all student conduct records pertaining to an individual student will be retained for five years (seven years for cases which are required to be included in the UCLA Jeanne Clery Crime Statistics Report ) from the end of the academic year in which the Notice of final disposition was issued in the most recent case.

During the record retention period described above, upon receipt of a request from professional schools, graduate programs, employers, or others, for the disciplinary records of a student, after the student provides an appropriate confidentiality waiver (where applicable), the Office of Student Conduct will only report and/or release records only where violations resulted in a sanction of deferred suspension, suspension, deferred dismissal, dismissal, or revocation of a degree.

VI. Amendment and Modification
Amendment of the UCLA Student Conduct Code may be made by the Chancellor in consultation with students, faculty, staff, and the Office of Student Conduct. Prior to adoption, such amendments will be submitted to the Office of the President for review for consistency with the policies of the University of California and state and federal law.

### A. Prohibited Conduct

1. **Harassment:** Unwelcome conduct based on an individual's actual or perceived Protected Category (See Section II.B.5) that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it unreasonably interferes with, denies, or adversely limits an individual's participation in or benefit from the education, employment, or other programs or activities of the University, and creates an environment that a reasonable person would find to be intimidating or offensive.

   In evaluating whether conduct is harassment, the Local Implementation Officer will consider the totality of the circumstances, including but not limited to:
   
   - The frequency, nature, and severity of the conduct;
   - Whether the conduct was physically threatening;
   - Whether the conduct arose in the context of other discriminatory conduct or other misconduct;
   - The effect of the conduct;
   - Whether the conduct would be objectively viewed as intimidating or offensive by a reasonable person; and
   - Whether the conduct may be protected by academic freedom or freedom of speech. When the investigation implicates academic freedom, the Local Implementation Officer will, based on locally developed procedures, consult with the appropriate academic officer for relevant academic expertise.
   
   This Policy addresses Harassment that is not covered under the University's Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment.

2. **Discrimination:** An Unfavorable Action taken because of an individual's actual or perceived Protected Category.

   a. **Unfavorable Action:** Adverse or unequal treatment under University authority that unreasonably denies, unreasonably limits, or materially interferes with an individual's ability to participate in programs, activities, or employment of the University, and/or receive services, benefits, or aid of the University, unless required or authorized by law.
   
   An Unfavorable Action is taken because of an individual's Protected Category. An Unfavorable Action will not exist where the action or inaction would have been taken regardless of the individual's Protected Category.
   
   Applying for or accepting research awards that contain eligibility restrictions that are permitted by state and federal law and that are required as a condition for funding does not constitute Prohibited Conduct under this Policy.
   
   b. **Failure to Accommodate:** Failure of the University to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals when required by law.
   
   For specific information about the provision of accommodations and the interactive process, please refer to other applicable policies, including but not limited to, the Guidelines Applying to Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability (PACAOS 140), Personnel Policies for Staff Members 81 (Reasonable Accommodation), and Academic Personnel Manual – 711 (Reasonable Accommodation for Academic Appointees with Disabilities)
   
   Note: Disparate Impact occurs when there is sufficient evidence that a University policy or practice, although neutral on its face, results in an adverse and material disproportionate impact on individuals within a particular Protected Category, unless the policy or practice has a substantial legitimate justification. The investigative process in this Policy is inapplicable to Disparate Impact concerns. Allegations of Disparate Impact raised by individuals allegedly adversely impacted by the policy or practice will be reviewed and addressed, as appropriate, by the Local Implementation Officer.

3. **Retaliation:** An adverse action against an individual based on:

   a. their report or other disclosure of alleged Discrimination and/or Harassment to a University employee or
   
   b. their participation in, or assistance with, the investigative process, reporting, remedial, or corrective action/disciplinary processes provided for in this Policy.
   
   An adverse action is conduct that would discourage a reasonable person from reporting Discrimination and/or Harassment or participating in a process provided for in this Policy, such as threats, intimidation, coercion, reprisals and adverse employment or educational actions. Good faith actions lawfully pursued in response to a report of Discrimination and/or Harassment (such as gathering evidence) are not, without more, Retaliation.

### B. Other Definitions:

1. **Complainant:** An individual alleged, in a report to the Local Implementation Officer, to have experienced Prohibited Conduct.

2. **Confidential Resources:** The following employees who receive information about Prohibited Conduct in their confidential capacity are Confidential Resources:
   
   a. Ombuds Office,
   
   b. Licensed counselors in student counseling centers and in employee assistance programs,
   
   c. Any individuals with a professional license requiring confidentiality (including health center employees but excluding campus legal counsel), or someone who is supervised by such an individual, and
   
   d. Pastoral counselors (individuals associated with a religious order or denomination, who are recognized by that religious order or denomination as someone who provides confidential counseling).
   
   Designation as a "Confidential Resource" under this Policy only exempts an individual from reporting to the Local Implementation Officer. It does not affect other mandatory reporting obligations under other policies or laws that require reporting to campus or local law enforcement, or Child Protective Services.

3. **Location:** Any University campus, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Medical Centers, the Office of the President, and Agriculture and Natural Resources.

4. **Preponderance of Evidence:** A standard of proof that requires that a fact be found when its occurrence, based on evidence, is more likely than not.

5. **Protected Category:** An identity protected by federal or state law, including the following: race, religion, color, citizenship, national or ethnic origin, ancestry, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, lactation or related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, gender transition, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability (including having a history of a disability or being regarded as being disabled), medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), predisposing genetic information (including family medical history), marital status, age (at least 40 years of age in employment context), or veteran or military status. The Protected Category definitions apply for the purposes of this Policy only.

6. **Respondent:** An individual who is alleged to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct and/or who has been reported to have violated this Policy.

7. **Responsible Employee:** Any of the following who is not a Confidential Resource:
   
   - Campus Police
   - Human Resources Administrators, Academic Personnel Administrators, and Discrimination and Title IX Professionals
   - Managers and Supervisors including Deans, Department Chairs, and Directors of Organized Research Units
   - Faculty Members
   
   If a Responsible Employee learns, in the course of employment, that any individual affiliated with the University may have experienced Prohibited Conduct, as defined in this Policy, the Responsible Employee must promptly notify the Local Implementation Officer or designee.

8. **Supportive and Remedial Measures**

   a. **Supportive Measures** include both Interim Measures and Mitigating Measures. The University provides Supportive Measures as appropriate and reasonably available, without fee or charge.
   
   i. **Interim Measures:** Services, accommodations, or other measures put in place temporarily after the Local Implementation Officer receives a report of Prohibited Conduct to assist or protect the Complainant, the Respondent, or the University community; restore or preserve a party's access to a University program or activity; or deter Prohibited Conduct. Interim Measures may:
      
      - remain in place until the final outcome of a Resolution Process (see Section V.A.5) or a subsequent disciplinary or appeal process;
      - change or terminate depending on the parties' evolving needs, as assessed by the Local Implementation Officer; or
      - become permanent as part of the resolution of a report.
   
   ii. **Mitigating Measures:** Services, accommodations, or other measures for a Complainant who is not in a Resolution Process (see Section V.A.5), including a Complainant who was previously in a Resolution Process that did not result in a finding of a policy violation. Mitigating Measures may be implemented to provide support, restore or preserve access to a University program or activity, or deter Prohibited Conduct.
   
   b. **Remedial Measures:** Services, accommodations, or other measures put in place as a result of a completed Resolution Process (see Section V.A.5).

9. **University Community Members:** any members of the University community, including faculty and other academic appointees, staff, student employees, students, coaches, clinicians, residents, interns, and third parties (such as contractors, volunteers, vendors, visitors, guests, and patients).

## III. POLICY TEXT

### A. General

Discrimination and Harassment pose a serious threat to the University's mission, values, and reputation. As such, the University is committed to creating and maintaining a community where all individuals can work and learn together in an inclusive environment. Prohibited Conduct violates this Policy and may violate the law.

Any individual can report conduct that may be Prohibited Conduct. The University will respond promptly and equitably to such reports. This includes appropriate action to stop, prevent, and remedy the Prohibited Conduct and, when appropriate, to impose corrective action/disciplinary measures on the Respondent.

This Policy addresses Prohibited Conduct that is not covered under the University's Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH). Local SVSH resource information can be found at Sexual Violence Prevention and Response.

This Policy is intended to be consistent with applicable state and federal laws and University policies.

### B. Policy Coverage

This Policy covers acts of Prohibited Conduct committed by University students (as defined in Section 14.00 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, including applicants who become students and former students as described in Section 101.00 of the Policy on Student Conduct and Discipline); employees; and third parties (such as contractors, volunteers, vendors, visitors, guests, and patients), and acts of Prohibited Conduct committed against students, employees, and third parties, when the conduct occurs:

1. on University property; or
2. in connection with University employment (including, for example, remote-work environments); or
3. in the context of a University program or activity (including, for example, University-sponsored study abroad, research, online courses, health services, or internship programs).

Consistent with Section 101.00 of the Policy on Student Conduct and Discipline, and as specified in implementing campus regulations, this Policy may cover Prohibited Conduct by students that occurs off campus.

Not every report of Prohibited Conduct will result in a Resolution Process in accordance with Section V.A.5, even if it is covered by this Policy. Rather, the Local Implementation Officer will close some reports after making an initial assessment (see Section V.A.4).

### C. Conduct that Violates this Policy

This Policy prohibits Prohibited Conduct as defined in Section II.A. Individuals may engage in Prohibited Conduct in person or through other means. This includes, but is not limited to, conduct involving physical actions and/or any form of communication, including, but not limited to, spoken, written, and non-verbal communication through any means including, but not limited to, electronic media, such as the internet, social networks, cell phones, texts, and other devices or forms of contact.

In addition, Prohibited Conduct may occur between individuals with the same Protected Category identity or different Protected Category identities.

### D. Protection of Complainants, Respondents, and Witnesses

1. The University prohibits Retaliation against someone for reporting possible Discrimination and/or Harassment or participating in a process under this Policy (See Section II.A.3).

2. The University must balance the privacy interests of individuals involved in a report of Prohibited Conduct against the need to gather information, ensure a fair process, and stop, prevent and remedy Prohibited Conduct. In this context, the University tries to protect an individual's privacy to the extent permitted by law and University policies. The University otherwise keeps confidential the identities of parties, witnesses and those who report Prohibited Conduct, except as required by law or permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and protects the privacy of personally identifiable information pursuant to all applicable state and federal privacy laws, and University policies.

### E. Free Speech and Academic Freedom

The faculty and other academic appointees, staff, and students of the University enjoy significant free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section II of the California Constitution. This Policy is intended to protect members of the University community from Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation, not to regulate protected speech. This Policy will be implemented in a manner that recognizes rights to freedom of speech and expression.

The University also has a compelling interest in free inquiry and the collective search for knowledge; it thus recognizes principles of academic freedom as a special area of protected speech. Consistent with these principles, no provision of this Policy will be interpreted to prohibit conduct that is legitimately related to course content, teaching methods, scholarship, or the public commentary of an individual faculty member, other academic appointee, or the educational, political, artistic, or literary expression of students in classrooms and public forums. Academic freedom, as described in Academic Personnel Manual - 010 (Academic Freedom), APM - 011 (Academic Freedom, Protection of Professional Standards, and Responsibilities of Non-Faculty Academic Appointees), and APM - 015 (The Faculty Code of Conduct), includes the right to express views, even in passionate terms, on matters of public importance. This right extends to curriculum and instruction within the classroom, which includes discussions, perspectives, information, and challenges to conventional beliefs.

Freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and academic freedom are essential to the mission of the University; the free exchange of ideas is necessary for the discovery and dissemination of knowledge. However, freedom of speech and academic freedom are not limitless and, for example, do not protect speech or expressive conduct that violates federal or state anti-discrimination laws.

### F. Confidential Resources

Individuals who have experienced Prohibited Conduct may speak confidentially with a Confidential Resource (see Section II.B.2). Confidential Resources are not Responsible Employees and need not report information they receive while acting in their confidential capacity to the Local Implementation Officer.

Disclosures to Confidential Resources while they are acting in their confidential capacity are not "reports" under this Policy and will not, alone, result in any formal University action. Confidential Resources may inform an individual who discloses experiencing possible Prohibited Conduct of the discloser's right to report directly to the Local Implementation Officer.

## IV. COMPLIANCE / RESPONSIBILITIES

### A. Implementation of the Policy

Executive Officers (the University President, Chancellor, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Director, or Vice President of Agriculture and Natural Resources or Executive Vice President of UC Health) can develop supplementary information to support implementation of this Policy. The Executive Director of the Systemwide Office of Civil Rights will interpret this Policy consistently and in a way that does not substantively change the Policy.

The Executive Officer at each Location must establish and implement local procedures consistent with this Policy. Exceptions to local implementation procedures required by the Policy must be approved by the Executive Officer or designee.

### B. Revisions to the Policy

The President approves this Policy and any revisions. The Executive Director of the Systemwide Office of Civil Rights may recommend revisions to the Policy consistent with approval authorities and applicable Bylaws, Standing Orders, and Policies of The Regents. The Executive Director of the Systemwide Office of Civil Rights will ensure that the Policy is reviewed regularly and updated in a manner that is consistent with other University policies.

### C. Approval of Actions

Actions within the Policy must be approved according to local procedures. Actions related to Senior Management Group employees must be approved by the President.

### D. Compliance with the Policy

The Executive Officer at each Location will designate the local management office that is responsible for monitoring, enforcing, and reporting policy compliance. The Senior Vice President – Chief Compliance and Audit Officer will periodically audit and monitor compliance with the Policy.

### E. Additional Enforcement Information

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), and the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) investigate reports of unlawful discrimination and harassment in employment. The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (DOE-OCR) investigates complaints of discrimination and harassment of students and employees in University programs or activities. The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office for Civil Rights (HHS-OCR) investigates complaints of discrimination and harassment occurring in the context of clinical, health, research, education, and employment programs. These agencies may serve as fact finders and attempt to facilitate the voluntary resolution of disputes. For more information, contact the nearest EEOC, OFCCP, CRD, DOE-OCR or HHS-OCR offices.

### F. Noncompliance with the Policy

Noncompliance with this Policy may result in remediation, educational efforts, informal counseling, adverse performance evaluations, corrective action/discipline, and termination/dismissal.

For students, consequences of engaging in Prohibited Conduct are governed by the Policy on Student Conduct and Discipline (PACAOS 100).

For policy-covered staff employees, corrective action/discipline is governed by Personnel Policies for Staff Members 62 (Corrective Action), 63 (Investigatory Leave), and 64 (Termination and Job Abandonment); Personnel Policies for Staff Members II-64 (Termination of Appointment), which applies to Senior Management Group (SMG) employees; and as applicable, other policies and procedures.

For academic personnel, formal corrective action/discipline is governed by Academic Personnel Manual - 015 (The Faculty Code of Conduct) and APM - 016 (University Policy on Faculty Conduct and the Administration of Discipline); APM - 150 (Non-Senate Academic Appointees/Corrective Action and Dismissal) and, as applicable, other policies and procedures. This Policy does not supplant disciplinary processes described in the APM or in the Academic Senate's Bylaws or regulations.

For represented employees, formal corrective action/discipline is governed by collective bargaining agreements.

## V. PROCEDURES

### A. Procedures for Reporting and Responding to Reports of Prohibited Conduct

This section provides an overview of the procedures the University uses to respond to reports of Prohibited Conduct. While the Local Implementation Officer has responsibility for oversight of the reporting and response processes, other offices at each Location will be involved and consulted as necessary. The specific procedures for investigating and resolving complaints of Prohibited Conduct depend on the Respondent's affiliation with the University. The Complainant and the Respondent are sometimes referred to together in this section as "the parties."

1. **Reporting**

   Any individual can report Prohibited Conduct. Reports can be made anonymously. Individuals may make a report to the Local Implementation Officer, any Responsible Employee, or another appropriate office such as the Academic Personnel Office, Student Affairs, Office of the Provost, or Human Resources Office. The individual or office that receives the report must forward it to the Local Implementation Officer. If the Responsible Employee to whom a report normally would be made is the Respondent, reports may be made to another Responsible Employee or office. Upon receipt of a report of Prohibited Conduct from a Responsible Employee, the Local Implementation Officer will attempt to contact the Complainant, if known, to inform them of their rights, options, and resources.

2. **Timelines for Making Reports**

   There is no time limit for reporting. Individuals should report incidents even if significant time has passed. However, the sooner the University receives a report, the better able it will be to respond, investigate, remedy, and impose corrective action/discipline if appropriate.

3. **Initial Assessment of a Report / Immediate Health and Safety**

   As soon as practicable after receiving a report, the Local Implementation Officer will make an initial assessment, including a limited factual inquiry when appropriate, to determine how to proceed.
   
   The Local Implementation Officer will next determine:
   
   - whether the report on its face alleges an act of Prohibited Conduct as defined in Section II.A; and
   - if so, whether the alleged Prohibited Conduct is covered by this Policy, as described in Section III.
   
   The Local Implementation Officer may consult with other offices as necessary. This may include Academic Personnel Offices for complaints involving faculty and other academic appointees, Student Affairs Offices for complaints involving students, Human Resources or Employee and Labor Relations Offices for complaints involving staff and health professionals or complaints stemming from a clinical encounter.
   
   The Local Implementation Officer will:
   
   - make an immediate assessment of the health and safety of the Complainant in consultation with the Complainant when possible,
   - make an immediate assessment of the health and safety of the campus community,
   - determine and oversee Supportive Measures that are deemed necessary upon initial assessment, and
   - engage in outreach to the Complainant that includes, for example, an explanation of rights and reporting options, a request to meet with the Local Implementation Office, and available campus and community resources.
   
   The Local Implementation Officer will also inform the Complainant of the range of possible outcomes of the report, including Supportive and Remedial Measures and corrective/disciplinary actions, and the procedures leading to such outcomes.

4. **Closure After Initial Assessment**

   Not all reports that the Local Implementation Officer receives are reports of Prohibited Conduct that can be resolved through a Resolution Process as described below. This includes reports for which the Local Implementation Officer determines that:
   
   - even if true, the alleged conduct is not Prohibited Conduct (see Section II.A and Section III.C, as limited by Section III.E); or
   - the alleged conduct is not covered by this Policy (see Section III.B); or
   - there is not enough information to carry out a Resolution Process (for example, the identities of the people involved are unknown); or
   - a Complainant's request that no Formal Investigation occur can be honored (see Section V.A.5.b); or
   - there is not enough nexus between the alleged conduct and the University to carry out a Resolution Process (for example, the conduct did not occur in the context of a University program or activity and involved only third parties).
   
   The Local Implementation Officer will close such matters pursuant to written guidelines issued by the Systemwide Office of Civil Rights. When appropriate, the Local Implementation Officer will take steps to stop the reported conduct, prevent its escalation or recurrence, and address its effects. Such steps may include, but are not limited to, offering resources, providing Mitigating Measures to the Complainant, providing targeted preventive education (including to the Respondent), and training programs.
   
   When the reported conduct is not Prohibited Conduct under this Policy but may be conduct prohibited by or addressed by other University policy or policies, the Local Implementation Officer will, if appropriate, refer the matter to another office for review and resolution.
   
   To determine whether there is enough nexus between the alleged conduct and the University to carry out a Resolution Process, the Local Implementation Officer will consider factors such as:
   
   - whether there is a connection between the alleged Prohibited Conduct and University property, University employment, or a University program or activity;
   - whether the Complainant or Respondent were University Community Members when the Prohibited Conduct allegedly occurred;
   - whether the Complainant or Respondent were University Community Members at the time of the report; and
   - whether there is information indicating an ongoing threat to the University community.

5. **Overview of Resolution Processes**

   Reports of Prohibited Conduct that are not closed after the Local Implementation Officer's initial assessment may be addressed through Alternative Resolution, Formal Investigation, a separate employee grievance or complaint process, or Other Inquiry. Each of these is described below. Resolution Processes are non-adversarial proceedings. At the beginning of any Resolution Process, the Local Implementation Officer will inform the parties of the University's rules of conduct during the process.

   a. **Alternative Resolution**
   
      Alternative Resolution is not available when the Complainant is a student and the Respondent is an employee. In other cases, after an initial assessment of the alleged facts, the Local Implementation Officer may—if the Complainant and Respondent agree in writing—begin an Alternative Resolution process (which may incorporate restorative principles and practices). The Local Implementation Officer will, if appropriate, begin the process in consultation with other offices depending on whether the Complainant and Respondent are faculty, other academic appointees, staff, student employees, or students. Alternative Resolution may include, among other responses:
      
      - separating the parties;
      - providing for safety;
      - referring the parties to counseling;
      - mediation;
      - referral for corrective action/discipline;
      - an agreement between the parties;
      - conducting targeted preventive educational and training programs; and
      - conducting a follow-up review to ensure that the resolution has been carried out effectively.
      
      Alternative Resolution may be especially useful when:
      
      - an investigation is not likely to lead to a resolution;
      - both parties prefer an informal process; or
      - a case involves less serious allegations.
      
      The Local Implementation Officer has discretion to determine whether the complaint is appropriate for Alternative Resolution; to determine the type of resolution to pursue; and to stop the process at any time before its conclusion and move to a Formal Investigation.
      
      Participation in Alternative Resolution is voluntary, meaning that both the Complainant and the Respondent must agree to participate. If Alternative Resolution is selected, the Local Implementation Officer will provide timely written notice to both parties that includes the allegations and states that:
      
      - the Local Implementation Officer has begun the process;
      - the process is voluntary and will end upon either party's request;
      - termination of the Alternative Resolution process may result in Formal Investigation;
      - the parties may be accompanied by an advisor throughout the process;
      - the Local Implementation Officer will notify both parties of the process's outcome; and
      - the process is private but not confidential; the Local Implementation Officer will maintain a record of the process and may share information with others if needed to carry out the resolution, and information shared by parties may be considered in any subsequent Resolution Process.
      
      The Local Implementation Officer will oversee the Alternative Resolution process and, if other campus officials are involved in the process, maintain an appropriate level of involvement.
      
      Once the parties have agreed to the terms of an Alternative Resolution, the University will not conduct a Formal Investigation unless the Local Implementation Officer determines that the Respondent failed to satisfy the terms of the Alternative Resolution, or that the Alternative Resolution was unsuccessful in stopping the Prohibited Conduct or preventing its recurrence.
      
      The Local Implementation Officer will keep records of all reports and conduct addressed through Alternative Resolution.

   b. **Formal Investigation**
   
      The Local Implementation Officer will begin a Formal Investigation when a decision has been made not to close a report after the initial assessment and either (i) Alternative Resolution and Other Inquiry are not appropriate, or (ii) the parties do not agree to participate in Alternative Resolution or it ends before they agree on terms. The Local Implementation Officer may coordinate the Formal Investigation with other offices, depending on the Complainant's and Respondent's affiliation with the University (i.e., faculty, other academic appointees, staff, or students).
      
      If the Complainant does not want a Formal Investigation, the Local Implementation Officer will give serious consideration to such a request. The Local Implementation Officer may, however, determine that a Formal Investigation is necessary to mitigate a risk to the campus community. If the Local Implementation Officer decides to open a Formal Investigation despite the Complainant's request, the Local Implementation Officer will:
      
      - inform the Complainant of the decision before beginning the Formal Investigation or otherwise notifying the Respondent of the Complainant's identity;
      - inform the Respondent that the Complainant did not request a Formal Investigation, but the Local Implementation Officer determined one was necessary; and
      - provide the Complainant with all information required by this Policy unless the Complainant states in writing that they do not want it.
      
      If the Local Implementation Officer does not begin a Formal Investigation, the Local Implementation Officer will inform the Complainant that this limits possible resolution options. The Local Implementation Officer will nonetheless provide Mitigating Measures as appropriate and consistent with Complainant's privacy and the absence of a Formal Investigation.
      
      At the beginning of a Formal Investigation, the Local Implementation Officer will provide the parties a written summary of the allegations, an explanation of their rights, the procedures that will be followed, available resources, and this Policy. While the parties have the right to identify evidence and witnesses, the University bears the burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility.
      
      i. **Timeframe.** The Local Implementation Officer will complete the Formal Investigation promptly, typically within 60 to 90 business days of notifying the parties in writing of the charges. However, the Local Implementation Officer may extend the timeframe past 90 business days for good cause. The Local Implementation Officer will periodically update parties on the status of the Formal Investigation and notify them in writing of the reason for any extension and the projected new timeline. The actual time required depends on the specific circumstances, including the complexity of the matter and the severity and extent of the alleged conduct. The Local Implementation Officer will consider, approve, and communicate extensions pursuant to written guidelines from the Systemwide Office of Civil Rights.
      
      If the police are also investigating the alleged conduct, the Local Implementation Officer will coordinate with the police but must nonetheless act promptly without delaying the Formal Investigation until the end of the criminal investigation.
      
      ii. **Disclosure of Information.** The Formal Investigation generally includes interviews with the parties and any witnesses, and a review of evidence. The Local Implementation Officer or designee will:
      
      - share information with witnesses only as reasonably necessary to conduct a fair and thorough investigation;
      - counsel witnesses about keeping confidential and private any information that they may learn through the Formal Investigation, to protect both the people involved and the integrity of the Formal Investigation; and
      - inform witnesses that information they provide directly related to the Formal Investigation and their identities will likely be disclosed to the Complainant and Respondent.
      
      iii. **Right to an Advisor.** The Complainant and Respondent may have an advisor present when they are interviewed and at meetings. They may have other support persons present under other policies. In addition, witnesses may have an advisor present at the discretion of the Local Implementation Officer or in accordance with University policy or a collective bargaining agreement.
      
      - The institution may restrict the extent and manner of the advisor's participation in the proceedings as long as restrictions apply equally to Complainants and Respondents.
      
      iv. **Academic Freedom.** When the Formal Investigation implicates academic appropriateness or academic freedom, the Local Implementation Officer will consult with the appropriate academic officer for relevant academic expertise.
      
      v. **University-Initiated Investigation.** The Local Implementation Officer may choose to begin and conduct a Formal Investigation without a Complainant when there is, for example:
      
      - information indicating an ongoing threat to the University community; or
      - a pattern of alleged conduct toward multiple people by the same Respondent that would, in the aggregate, constitute Prohibited Conduct (see Section II.A.) for a reasonable person; or
      - an allegation of Prohibited Conduct covered by this Policy in the public realm (such as reports in the news or social media).
      
      vi. **Administrative Closure.** The Local Implementation Officer may close a Formal Investigation before completing it if they determine that a significant change in circumstances has so substantially impaired the Formal Investigation that the Local Implementation Officer cannot reach reasonably reliable conclusions about whether the alleged conduct occurred. The Local Implementation Officer will, when appropriate, still take steps to stop the reported conduct, prevent its escalation or recurrence, and address its effects, including offering appropriate resources to the parties and Mitigating Measures to the Complainant.

   c. **Grievance/Complaint Procedures for Employees**
   
      Instead of, or in addition to, reporting to the Local Implementation Officer or other Responsible Employee, a University employee may file a grievance or complaint. That grievance or complaint must meet all of the requirements, including time limits for filing, under the applicable complaint resolution or grievance procedure listed in Appendix I: University Complaint Resolution and Grievance Procedures. Any such grievance or complaint that alleges that any individual affiliated with the University may have experienced Prohibited Conduct will be forwarded to the Local Implementation Officer for processing under this Policy, and the grievance or complaint procedure may be held in abeyance pending resolution under this Policy, unless an applicable collective bargaining agreement provides otherwise. After completion of the process under this Policy, the grievance or complaint may be reactivated under the applicable grievance or complaint procedure.

   d. **Other Inquiry**
   
      When a report is not closed after initial assessment, yet is not appropriate for Alternative Resolution nor Formal Investigation because there is no individual identifiable Respondent over whom the Local Implementation Officer has jurisdiction, the Local Implementation Officer may:
      
      - conduct an inquiry to try to determine what occurred and
      - take prompt steps reasonably calculated to stop any substantiated conduct, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its effects.
      
      Such an inquiry may be appropriate when, for example, the Complainant alleges Prohibited Conduct by an organization, an individual whose identity is unknown, or a third party, or alleges conduct by multiple people that rises to the level of Prohibited Conduct only when considered in the aggregate.
      
      The extent of the inquiry and responsive steps will depend on the specific circumstances. This includes, for example:
      
      - the nature and location of the alleged conduct,
      - the University's relationship to the Complainant, and
      - the University's relationship to and level of control over the organization or individual alleged to have engaged in the conduct.
      
      The Local Implementation Officer will complete the inquiry promptly and notify the Complainant of the outcome.

   e. **Notifications and Documentation**
   
      When engaging in a Resolution Process provided for in this Section V.A.5., the Local Implementation Officer will provide written notices to the parties and keep records.

6. **Formal Investigation Report and Outcome**

   If a Formal Investigation is conducted, the Local Implementation Officer will prepare a written report that includes:
   
   - the factual allegations and alleged Policy violations;
   - statements of the parties;
   - a summary of the evidence;
   - credibility determinations when appropriate;
   - findings of fact; and
   - an analysis and determination of whether this Policy was violated.
   
   In determining whether this Policy was violated, the Local Implementation Officer will apply the Preponderance of Evidence standard.
   
   At the end of the Formal Investigation, the Local Implementation Officer will simultaneously provide the parties the Formal Investigation report. The report may be redacted to protect privacy (see APM - 160 and other University policies governing privacy). The Local Implementation Officer will also inform the parties in writing of the outcome of the Formal Investigation and its rationale, and of any available next steps.

7. **Remedy**

   a. If the University finds Prohibited Conduct, the University will take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to stop the violation, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its effects. For examples of available Remedial Measures, see Appendix II.
   
   b. If the remedy has not already been provided, the Local Implementation Officer will oversee its implementation in consultation with appropriate administrators. The Local Implementation Officer will also consider whether any systemic remedies are appropriate.

8. **Corrective Action/Discipline**

   a. The Local Implementation Officer will forward the Formal Investigation Report (with attachments) to the appropriate administrator responsible for possible further action, including corrective action/discipline.
   
   b. Any member of the University community who is found to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct may be subject to corrective/disciplinary action, up to and including termination/dismissal pursuant to the applicable University disciplinary procedure or other policy.
   
   c. At the end of any corrective/disciplinary procedure the Complainant and the Respondent will be informed, in writing, of:
   
   - the outcome, including the final determination regarding the alleged offense, if there was any appropriate action taken, and the rationale for the results;
   - any available next steps; and
   - any subsequent change to the results and when results become final.
   
   The University tries to finalize and notify parties of corrective action/disciplinary decisions reasonably promptly pursuant to applicable procedures, depending on the severity and extent of the Prohibited Conduct and the complexity of the matter.

### B. Location Responsibilities

Each Location must do the following:

1. Designate and provide adequate resources and independence to a Local Implementation Officer. The responsibilities of the Local Implementation Officer include, but may not be limited to, the following duties:

   a. Coordinate compliance with this policy, including investigations, reports, and remedies.
   
   b. Coordinate with other responsible units to ensure that Supportive and Remedial Measures determined necessary by the Local Implementation Officer are provided.
   
   c. Provide educational materials to promote compliance with the Policy and familiarity with local reporting procedures.
   
   d. Respond promptly and equitably to reports of Prohibited Conduct according to the Policy.

2. Designate individuals who can offer confidential consultations, without reporting the incident to the Local Implementation Officer, to any member of the University community seeking information or advice about making a report of Prohibited Conduct. Each Location will post information about how and where to contact Confidential Resources on its website.

3. Individuals who consult with such Confidential Resources will be advised that their discussions in these settings are not considered actual reports of Prohibited Conduct and that without additional action by the individual, these discussions will not, alone, result in any formal action by the University to resolve their concerns.

4. Follow University established and approved processes for investigation, adjudication, and corrective action/discipline.

5. Publicize a Location-specific process for reporting incidents of Prohibited Conduct.

## VII. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1. **What are "associational" Discrimination and Harassment and are they covered by this Policy?**

   Associational Discrimination or Harassment are based on a Complainant's association or relationship with an individual or individuals who are, or who are perceived to be, within a Protected Category. Associational Discrimination and Harassment are covered by this Policy.

2. **Is Prohibited Conduct based on "caste" covered by this Policy?**

   Yes. The University interprets its protection against Prohibited Conduct on the basis of "ancestry" to include protection against Discrimination and Harassment on the basis of an individual's caste. The University interprets the term "caste" to mean an individual's perceived position in a system of social stratification on the basis of inherited status. Caste may be characterized by factors that may include, but are not limited to, inability or restricted ability to alter inherited status; socially enforced restrictions on marriage, private and public segregation, and discrimination; and social exclusion on the basis of perceived status.

3. **What are examples of Prohibited Conduct based on national or ethnic origin or ancestry under this Policy?**

   Prohibited Conduct under the Policy based on national or ethnic origin or ancestry extends to individuals who experience Discrimination or Harassment based on their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, or citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity. This includes, for example, antisemitic, anti-Arab, and Islamophobic Discrimination or Harassment. Some of these forms of Discrimination or Harassment may also represent Prohibited Conduct based on other Protected Categories covered by this Policy, including based on religion.
   
   Examples of such Discrimination or Harassment may include:
   
   - A professor bars Jewish students from a seminar on the Middle East based on the belief that their ties to Israel will polarize class discussions.
   - A student repeatedly refers to a Palestinian-American student as a "terrorist," removes and destroys the student's keffiyeh, and threatens the student with physical harm if he attends campus events.
   - An employee repeatedly tells a fellow Asian-American employee to "go back to China," follows the employee to her vehicle after work, and physically intimidates her, leaving her fearful to go to work.
   - A faculty member declines to hire a Mexican-American graduate student as a research assistant because the faculty member says the student "belongs in Mexico, not in California."
   - Denying access to or participation in any University program or activity based on how an individual looks or dresses (e.g., use of religious or ethnic attire such as a hijab, burka, turban, or kippah).

4. **What constitutes Discrimination on the basis of disability covered under this Policy?**

   Discrimination on the basis of disability can occur in a variety of forms of different treatment or denial of equitable opportunity. For example, individuals might experience a barrier to access a University program or activity because of inaccessible "brick and mortar" facilities, online web content, or other digital content, such as mobile applications. Individuals may not have an equal opportunity or access to participate in an academic program without appropriate academic adjustments or auxiliary aids and services and/or reasonable modifications in policy, practice, or procedure; or in the workplace without reasonable accommodations. Also, individuals may experience disability-based Harassment or an Unfavorable Action based on disability as defined in the Policy. Individuals alleging any of these types of Discrimination or Harassment on the basis of disability may choose to bring a complaint under the Policy.

5. **How does this Policy interact with other existing policies and procedures related to disability discrimination?**

   Individuals may choose to file a complaint under this Policy for Discrimination or Harassment on the basis of disability with their Local Implementation Officer, or they may choose to proceed according to other existing campus/location procedures related to informal resolution, reporting, or appeals the location makes available. The University encourages individuals to engage in early resolution processes campuses make available to resolve specific concerns regarding disability-related claims as they may provide for a timely resolution of the concern(s). For specific information about other policies and procedures related to discrimination on the basis of disability, please refer to the Guidelines Applying to Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability (PACAOS 140), Personnel Policies for Staff Members 81 (Reasonable Accommodation), and Academic Personnel Manual - 711 (Reasonable Accommodation for Academic Appointees with Disabilities), as well as local campus resources. Employees may also contact their campus Disability Management office and students may contact their campus Students with Disabilities Services office, and individuals may also contact their campus ADA Coordinator for additional information.

6. **Can I make an anonymous report under this Policy?**

   The Anti-Discrimination Policy allows for anonymous reporting by any person (whether or not the Complainant) unless you are a Responsible Employee. However, it is important to note that if you make a report anonymously the University may be limited in its ability to respond, meet your desired resolution, and/or keep you updated on the status of the complaint. Although a report is received anonymously, the University may have to move forward to address the concern and the Respondent may discern the reporter's identity due to the nature of the complaint. Depending on the information reported, the University may be limited in its response. For example, the University may be limited to respond if the name/identifying information about the accused is not provided.

7. **I am a Responsible Employee. How do I fulfill my obligation?**

   When an individual discloses a possible incident of Prohibited Conduct, you should inform the individual that you are a Responsible Employee who must report any information the individual shared with you to the Local Implementation Officer. As a Responsible Employee, you must contact your Local Implementation Officer as soon as possible and share whatever information you have, including the names of any individuals involved, their contact information, and any details of the incident. As a Responsible Employee, you should report to the Local Implementation Officer even if you are unsure that the incident actually occurred or whether it constitutes Prohibited Conduct. If your job responsibilities ordinarily would require you to investigate a report of disruptive behavior or intervene or resolve the issue, consult with counsel before taking any steps to assure compliance with all applicable laws and policies. If your job responsibilities ordinarily require you to address concerns regarding disability discrimination, including issues with reasonable accommodations/modifications, consult with your Local Implementation Officer about responsible employee reporting obligations and expectations.

8. **How should the University proceed when campus or local law enforcement agencies ("police") are conducting a criminal investigation while the University is conducting a parallel Resolution Process?**

   If the Respondent's alleged conduct is also the subject of a criminal investigation, the Local Implementation Officer will coordinate its Resolution Process with the police. The fact-finding portion of an investigation may be delayed temporarily during the evidence-gathering stage of the criminal investigation. During this delay, the University may put Interim Measures in place. The length of time for evidence gathering by criminal investigators will vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case.

9. **Who can be considered an advisor as described in this Policy?**

   An advisor may be any person, except another party or potential witness, who provides the Complainant or Respondent with guidance or advice (including attorneys). The University may restrict the extent and manner of the advisor's participation in the proceedings as long as the restrictions apply equally to Complainants and Respondents. At the beginning of any Resolution Process, the Local Implementation Officer will inform parties of the University's rules of conduct during the process, and potential consequences if an advisor does not meet those standards, including disqualification from further services as the advisor.

10. **Once the outcome of an investigation or disciplinary proceeding under this Policy is disclosed to the parties, can they be asked to keep this information confidential?**

    The Complainant and Respondent can be advised of the private and sensitive nature of the allegations, personnel and student discipline, and other matters that arise under this Policy but should not be restricted from discussing the allegations or gathering evidence (provided their conduct is not Retaliation as defined in Section II.A.3.), or from further disclosing information about outcomes.

11. **I am covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Does this Policy apply to me?**

    Yes. However, please note that consequences of non-compliance with this Policy, and relevant complaint resolution, grievance and disciplinary procedures, for employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with an exclusive bargaining agent are governed by the appropriate collective bargaining agreement.

12. **Does this Policy's prohibition on sex discrimination include Discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, sexual orientation, and gender identity?**

    Yes. This Policy prohibits Discrimination based on sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, gender transition, and sexual orientation, all of which are Protected Categories under this Policy. These categories include prohibited conduct based on sex characteristics (which term typically refers to physiological sex characteristics based on a person's anatomy, hormones, or chromosomes), trans identities, and those who identify as intersex.

13. **What are some examples of Discrimination based on gender identity covered by this Policy?**

    Discrimination on the basis of one's gender identity in the workplace may include being denied a promotion, pay raise, or training opportunity based on one's gender identity. Discrimination on the basis of gender identity in the educational environment can include exclusion from use of restroom facilities that align with one's gender identity, or requiring transgender students to stay in a single-occupancy room or to disclose personal information that other students are not required to disclose.

14. **What are some examples of Discrimination based on sexual orientation covered by this Policy?**

    Discrimination on the basis of one's sexual orientation in the workplace may include being denied a promotion, pay raise, or training opportunity based on one's sexual orientation.
    
    Discrimination on the basis of one's sexual orientation in the education environment includes situations where a student is denied the same opportunities, benefits, or access to educational programs because of their sexual orientation. For example, a student is denied the opportunity to be a Resident Assistant for a campus residence hall because they self-identify as a lesbian.
    
    If you believe you have been subjected to Discrimination on the basis of gender identity and/or sexual orientation, please contact your Local Implementation Officer. In addition, should you believe you have been harassed on the basis of gender identity and/or sexual orientation (including sex stereotypes and sex characteristics), please contact your Title IX Officer. Please note that at some campuses or locations, the Local Implementation Officer and Title IX Officer may be the same person.

15. **Does this Policy prohibit Discrimination based on pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions?**

    Yes. This Policy defines Discrimination on the basis of sex to include actual or perceived pregnancy, childbirth, lactation, or related medical conditions, as well as recovery. Discrimination on the basis of sex also includes Discrimination based on termination of pregnancy. For example, a Resident Assistant tells a pregnant student they have to move to a new room on the first floor because of their pregnancy to avoid pre-term labor by climbing stairs to their third-floor dorm room. In addition, failure of an employee to provide a reasonable modification that has been approved by the Title IX Officer or their designee may constitute Discrimination in violation of this Policy. Individuals are encouraged to contact their local Title IX Office with any questions.

16. **Does this Policy prohibit Harassment based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions?**

    Yes. This Policy defines Harassment on the basis of sex to include actual or perceived pregnancy, childbirth, lactation, or related medical conditions, as well as recovery. Further, Harassment on the basis of sex includes harassment based on termination of pregnancy. For example, a pregnant student has trouble sitting at a classroom table and their professor makes fun of them and calls attention to their physical condition in an embarrassing or demeaning manner.

17. **What are examples of pregnancy-related conditions?**

    Pregnancy-related fatigue, dehydration (or the need for increased water intake), nausea (or morning sickness), increased body temperature, anemia, and bladder dysfunction; gestational diabetes; preeclampsia; hyperemesis gravidarum (i.e., severe nausea and vomiting); pregnancy-induced hypertension (high blood pressure); infertility; recovery from childbirth, miscarriage, or pregnancy termination; ectopic pregnancy; prenatal or postpartum depression; and lactation conditions such as swelling or leaking of breast tissue or mastitis.

18. **What is the responsibility of any UC employee if a student discloses to them that they are pregnant or have a pregnancy-related condition?**

    When any employee is notified by a student (or person with the legal right to act on their behalf) of a student's pregnancy or related condition, unless the employee reasonably believes that the campus Title IX Officer has been notified (for example, the student tells their professor they met with the Title IX Officer already), the employee must provide that person with: 1) the Title IX Officer's contact information; and 2) explain the Title IX Officer's role to coordinate specific actions to prevent sex discrimination (including pregnancy and related conditions) and ensure the student's equal access to the University's programs and activities. Though the Local Implementation Officer (LIO) is responsible for implementation of this Policy, the Title IX Officer, who may also act as the LIO, ultimately has responsibility for ensuring compliance with UC's Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy.
    
    For example:
    1. If a professor overhears a student telling other students they are pregnant, does the professor need to provide the Title IX Officer contact information and explain their role? No.
    2. If a student directly tells a professor that they are pregnant, does the professor need to provide the student with the Title IX Officer's contact information and explain their role? Yes.

19. **I am a student with a healthy pregnancy. Am I protected from Prohibited Conduct under this Policy and, if so, based on disability or sex?**

    Sex. However, please check the local processes at your campus. While the Title IX Officer has an obligation to facilitate reasonable modifications for you based on your pregnancy and any pregnancy-related conditions, they may delegate that responsibility to another University partner who is best positioned to facilitate those services for you. If you have any questions, contact your campus Title IX Officer for assistance. Moreover, if you have complications during your pregnancy, you may also qualify for support services as a student with a disability. For questions about those services, please contact your campus Disability Services office.

20. **What are examples of common reasonable modifications for students who are pregnant or who have related conditions?**

    Breaks during class to express breast milk, breastfeed, or attend to health needs associated with pregnancy or related conditions, including eating, drinking, or using the restroom; intermittent absences to attend medical appointments; changes in schedule or course sequence; extensions of time for coursework and rescheduling tests/exams; allowing a student to sit or stand or to carry or keep water nearby; counseling; changes in physical space or supplies (e.g., access to larger desk or footrest); and elevator access.
    
    Note: A modification that would fundamentally alter the nature of a University program or activity is not a reasonable modification.

21. **If I am a pregnant student with a healthy pregnancy, what type of documentation must I produce to receive reasonable modifications?**

    The Title IX Officer or their designee will only request documentation that is necessary and reasonable to determine the appropriate reasonable modifications, which information will be safeguarded consistent with applicable privacy laws; further, they will consult you in the process and make an individualized determination. Circumstances where the need is obvious and documentation would not be required include the need for a bigger uniform; where the student previously provided supporting documentation; where the student indicates they are pregnant and asks for the following during class: to carry or keep water nearby and drink it, use of a bigger desk, ability to sit or stand, or take breaks to eat, drink, or use the restroom; lactation needs; and accommodations available to students for reasons other than pregnancy without requiring supporting documentation.

22. **I am an employee who is pregnant or has pregnancy-related conditions. Am I protected from Prohibited Conduct under this Policy?**

    Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation against employees based on pregnancy, childbirth, lactation, and other related medical conditions is prohibited under this Policy. The University will also provide reasonable accommodations for a qualified employee's known limitations related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition unless the accommodation would cause an undue hardship. Employees should contact their campus disability management team for additional information.

23. **Are there any requirements for a space to qualify as a lactation space?**

    Yes. A lactation space must: not be a bathroom; be safe, clean and free from hazardous materials; be shielded from view and have a locking door; be free from intrusion from others; contain a surface to place a breast pump and personal items; contain a place to sit and have access to electricity; and have access to a sink with running water. The lactation space also must be functional, appropriate, and safe for use. Medical documentation is not required to request access to a lactation space.

### Appendix II: Supportive and Remedial Measures

In determining Supportive Measures, the Local Implementation Officer will tailor the measures to the circumstances of each case, minimize burdens on the parties, and avoid depriving the parties of educational and employment opportunities as much as practicable. Supportive Measures are non-disciplinary and non-punitive and should not unreasonably burden a party.

When determining Supportive and/or Remedial Measures (as defined in Section II.B.8), the Local Implementation Officer will assess how much the University can protect the parties' privacy while also ensuring the Measures are effective. The Local Implementation Officer will explain to the parties any limits on protecting their privacy. Supportive and Remedial Measures must also be consistent with the parties' First Amendment rights.

The Local Implementation Officer may issue a no-contact order as a Supportive or Remedial Measure, but only where less restrictive measures would be insufficient to protect the safety of the Complainant or the University's environment.

In addition to Supportive and Remedial measures, the Local Implementation Officer may take other actions in accordance with existing policies and procedures to stop reported conduct, prevent its escalation or recurrence, and address its effects.

While not required, the Local Implementation Officer, within their sole discretion and in consultation with other offices as appropriate, may provide Supportive and Remedial Measures including, but not limited to:

**A. Campus Services Generally:**
Academic, employment, and other support including academic tutoring, counseling, disability services, health and mental health services, housing assistance, legal assistance, referral to employee assistance program, and information about the right to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement.

**B. Measures that May Be Available to Employees, Including Faculty, Academic Appointees, Staff, and Student Employees:**
Change to a different workstation, schedule, work location, unit, department, or position for which the employee is qualified provided that, in the case of a Complainant, the change is voluntary and equitable.

**C. Training and Education of the Respondent:**
The Respondent may be required to undergo training and/or periodic refresher classes.

**D. Campus Services Modified:**
1. If a campus service is not generally available or a fee is imposed, access may be arranged, or fees waived when appropriate.
2. Comprehensive services including additional medical, counseling, and academic support services.
3. Any other accommodations or Interim Measures that are reasonably available once a Complainant has requested them.

**E. Additional Educational Measures for Students:**
1. Change advisors, composition of dissertation committee, class sections and similar schedule adjustments.
2. Arrange extra time to complete academic requirements of a class or program, or to retake a class or withdraw from a class, without an academic or financial penalty if the University delayed such accommodations after it reasonably should have known of the violation.

**F. Other Measures Devised by the Local Implementation Officer or Other Administrator.**

# Free Speech on Campus: The Basics, The Myths, The Challenges
Version 1.1 | released 2023.10.25

## INTRODUCTION

Free speech is critical to every democracy's health and longevity. The same goes for higher education, where freedom of expression and freedom of inquiry form bedrock principles central to our mission to pursue knowledge and understanding.

But translating theoretical principles into real-world practice is messy. One reason is because freedom of speech is both made possible by and limited by other rights and values, such as equality. On the one hand, freedom of speech requires equality. For example, what genuine freedom of speech is there if the most marginalized and dissenting cannot join the conversation? On the other hand, freedom of speech can undermine equality? For example, what if a speaker mocks, harasses, or intimidates certain groups, which interferes with their ability to learn in the classroom? What then should universities do?

None of this easy. And caricatures, strawpersons, and ad hominems don't help. But the point of a university is to struggle with the most challenging issues of our times. We invite you to engage with us in this struggle, as we explore some law, consider some arguments, and think through our disagreements. In other words, join us as we muddle through, in good faith.

The following pages offer a point of departure for this journey. This isn't legal advice. It's not even meant as official University policy. It's instead the start of a public conversation. Our analysis is incomplete, a work-in-progress, consistent with the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion's ethos that embraces reflection, revision, and reiteration. For additional resources regarding free speech on college campuses, please visit our "Freedom of Speech" webpage.

After reading this document, please exercise your free speech rights and let us know what you think. Email us at WeListen@equity.ucla.edu (please include "Free Speech Guidance" in the subject line). Dissenting voices are, of course, welcome.

## PART I: FREE SPEECH 101

### Whose Right is it, Anyway?

#### It's my (First Amendment) Right!

When we call something a "right," we're often speaking loosely—asserting that we are entitled to act or decide without any interference. But let's be more precise and focus on a formal "right" recognized under law. The federal right to "Freedom of Speech" is contained within the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. It states: "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . ."

#### Bill of Rights

The First Amendment is one of ten Amendments within the Bill of Rights, which Congress adopted, and the States ratified, in 1791. The purpose of the Bill of Rights was to protect individuals against government power. Initially, the Bill of Rights was understood to apply only against the federal government (e.g., laws passed by Congress), but after the Fourteenth Amendment (adopted in 1868), the Supreme Court held that most of its provisions apply also to the states and local governments.

### Who Must Comply with the 1st Amendment?

#### The Government (i.e., State Actors)

The First Amendment, like almost every other constitutional provision, applies only to "state actors"—that is, the government and those working on its behalf. Thus, if your friends tell you to shut up, they may be limiting your speech, but they are not violating the First Amendment. Why? Because they're not the government. The same goes for Google, even when it fires an employee because of her speech. Why? Same answer. As large and powerful as it is, Google isn't the government (unless it's acting at the government's behest). Other laws, such as contract law or labor law, may have been broken. But not the First Amendment. Free speech values, principles, or goals may have been compromised. But again no First Amendment rights were violated.

#### What about UCLA?

Does the First Amendment apply to UCLA? Yes, because as an extension of the California government, UCLA is a state actor. So, if UCLA constrains your freedom of speech, then the First Amendment most definitely applies.

#### And the Privates?

Private universities generally are not considered "state actors," which means that the Constitution doesn't apply to them. That said, most private universities voluntarily govern themselves as if they were subject to the First Amendment and, quite often, have promised (through contract) to do so. Also, some state statutes—including the Leonard Law in California—expressly apply First Amendment norms to student speech at private universities.

### Why Protect Speech?

#### It's Essential to a Healthy Democracy

We protect speech because words and expressive conduct can do glorious things. They can inform us of startling facts and new discoveries. They can teach us novel theories and buried histories. They can persuade us to shift our views and understandings. They can move us with rhyme and meter and gorgeous metaphor.

More fundamentally, we value free speech because it is essential to a healthy democracy. At its most basic level, freedom of speech permits us to dissent from government conduct—whether by poster, tweet, or raised fist, and whether it's disagreement with domestic affairs, foreign policy, or public monuments. Without this protection, the government could punish speech it disliked. Say a prayer, go to jail. Speak your mind, pay a fine. Would you want to live in such a society? Would you want a UCLA Administrator, California Governor, or United States President to wield such power?

#### And to the University and Its Mission

Freedom of speech carries special import on university campuses such as ours. As a public institution in Southern California, we proudly celebrate the robust diversity of perspectives, beliefs, and values that exists amongst us. But such heterogeneity means there will be conflict and passionate disagreement. Of course, UCLA should do everything possible to ensure that those disagreements are debated on-the-merits, with clarifications, concessions, persuasion, and respect. But the bottom line is that we want that diversity of viewpoints to be aired, debated, and considered, not trapped inside single-minded echo chambers.

In addition, UCLA vociferously defends its commitment to "academic freedom," which among various meanings includes the freedom to inquire. There's no constitutional provision that explicitly addresses academic freedom, but the Supreme Court has described it as a "special concern of the First Amendment." The freedom to communicate (speech) and the (academic) freedom to inquire are both essential to the university's fundamental mission, "which is to discover knowledge and to disseminate it to its students and to society at large."

#### But there are Costs

We'll say more about this shortly, but we are compelled at this point to state clearly that free speech comes with great costs. Words and expressive conduct can wound in severe and concrete ways. For a university, any discussion about freedom of speech is incomplete without recognizing that speech can derail other fundamental commitments—for instance, to ensure that all students, regardless of identity, can live, learn, and study in an equal learning environment.

### How Does The First Amendment Work?

#### What's In: Expressive Conduct

The First Amendment's "freedom of speech" not only protects oral speech but also "expressive conduct," which includes any conduct intended to communicate an idea or message that can be reasonably understood. Consequently, "freedom of speech" could cover texting with emojis, wearing a black armband, flashing a gang sign, burning a cross, wearing a particular type of hat, or kneeling during the national anthem.

#### What's Out: Categorical Exceptions

The Supreme Court has carved out various categories of speech as "unprotected speech" or "less protected speech." Here's the main list:

• incitement of imminent lawless action;
• fighting words (addressed at a specific individual to trigger an immediate fistfight);
• true threats;
• defamation (false statements of fact published with a particularly reckless state of mind that harms reputation);
• obscenity (which is not quite the same as pornography);
• harassment;
• and child pornography (which involves actual minors).

If your speech falls into one of these categories—which are all legal terms of art—state actors need little justification to constrain or punish that speech.

#### Content-based Restrictions: Presumptively Bad

Content-based restrictions are generally unconstitutional. Thus, if a university wants to ban speech because of the content of the message (e.g., speech about abortion, or affirmative action, or Middle East politics), it is really, really hard to do consistent with the First Amendment.

#### Content-Neutral Restrictions: Presumptively Good

Suppose Residential Life doesn't want music blaring in the dorms after midnight? They don't care whether you're playing Bieber or Drake, Mozart or Chopin, a podcast or a movie. If you're forced to turn off your speakers because people need their sleep, is that unconstitutional? It is your speech after all.

It turns out that the First Amendment is (appropriately) more flexible and tolerant of "content-neutral" speech restrictions – that is, restrictions unrelated to the content of someone's speech. Another label for them is "time, place, and manner" restrictions because they concern precisely that: the time (after midnight), place (in the dorms), and manner (via loudspeakers) in which an individual may speak. In this example, UCLA just wants students to be able to sleep through the night. For content-neutral restrictions, the government need only show that it is pursuing some "significant" interest that does not burden substantially more speech than necessary, a relatively lower burden.

But here's the worry. Sometimes governments employ what they claim are mere "time, place, and manner" regulations to suppress a message they dislike. For example, if these regulations are extraordinarily vague or they are unevenly applied—say, employed to censor some speakers but not others—people could reasonably question whether the constraints (or their application) are content-neutral after all.

### The Costs

#### Words Matter

While speech protections produce real benefits, we should be honest that these protections entail real costs and consequences. Words and expression can do awful things. They can insult and mock. They can grievously wound. They can gossip and betray. They can lie. They can intimidate and threaten. They can fake the news and be weaponized to deceive, manipulate, and sow discord. They can become memes that lead kids to bully, tribes to kill, nations to war.

As children, we were taught to sing "sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me." If only that were entirely true. Words can devastate—offline and on, even when the speaker doesn't intend to do so. This reality explains why free speech doctrine has categorical exceptions, such as child pornography and true threats.

#### But, "Hate Speech" is Protected Speech

Lots of people say "Hate Speech is NOT Free Speech." But this inaccurately describes the law: there is no categorical exception for "hate speech." Notwithstanding the harm it causes, "hate speech" is protected speech. We understand and appreciate the instinct to bar "hate speech," particularly on a college campus, and particularly given our country's legacy of genocide, slavery, exclusion, internment, and Jim Crow, and the ongoing ways in which speech is deployed to marginalize groups (for instance, transgendered people) and challenge even their most basic rights to exist, free from violence. But as a descriptive statement of law, the assertion "hate speech is not free speech" is just plain wrong. The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws—including university "speech codes"—that penalize or otherwise regulate "hate speech."

#### "Is" versus "Should"

Whether hateful speech should be protected is a different question on which reasonable minds can and do disagree. In fact, some democracies like France and Germany criminalize certain forms of hateful speech. Our view is that that although any existing law—including First Amendment law—is contingent, contestable, and hardly inevitable, it is always critical to know what that existing law is. Thus, when we enter debates about freedom of speech, including hate speech, let's take care to distinguish between "what is" the law and what we think the law "should be," and not confuse the two. Recognizing this distinction is not meant to foreclose earnest debate about constitutional doctrine, civil disobedience, institutional design, or radical change. It is simply to engage that debate with clarity.

#### What's up for Debate

As you might have guessed, legal debates about free speech often target whether someone's speech falls into one of the previously identified categorical exceptions. After all, what counts as a "true threat"? What's "obscenity"? And most important, what counts as "harassment?" Those who seek to create a whole new exception or increase the scope of recognized exceptions face an uphill battle. For good or bad, the Supreme Court has interpreted what counts as "unprotected speech" and "less protected speech" narrowly and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future.

## PART II: MYTH BUSTING

### Myth #1: Truth Always Prevails in the Marketplace of Ideas

Often people emphasize that the antidote to (bad, including hateful) speech is more (good) speech. They reassure us that in the "marketplace of ideas," truth will always win out. But that's an empirical claim, and if inspected carefully, seems naive. In the marketplace of music, fashion, and food, winners are often determined by popularity, not by what's best, the highest quality, or the most truthful.

Plus, power matters. Some people have more opportunities to speak than others; more resources to disseminate their speech than others; more opportunities to be heard than others; and more opportunities to drown out the voices of others. Speech "marketplaces," like other marketplaces, often fail to function as we hope they would. Remember, that's why we regulate markets through tools such as antitrust law and consumer protection law.

If power matters and the "best" ideas don't always prevail, why do we continue to say more speech is always better? The truth is, people who recommend "better" speech to counter "bad" speech do so not because they believe that pursuing that path will guarantee truth or produce the best ideas. It's because if we fail to respond at all, the perceived "bad" ideas go unchallenged by the perceived "good" ones.

### Myth #2: Freedom-of-Speech is Everything

Yes, we care about freedom of speech—a constitutional value and right—but we care about other constitutional values and rights as well, such as our commitment to equality as mandated by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The difficulty is that sometimes freedom of speech promotes equality (by, for example, preventing the government from silencing marginalized voices) and sometimes it does not (by, for example, permitting the use of racial epithets).

Consider the messy example of harassment, which can include sexual harassment or racial harassment. Sexual harassment violates UC policy and can violate employment and education law. But how does harassment take place? Often through words and expressive conduct (as in pictures). If some coworker insists on pinning pornography to his cubicle walls, those images will predictably impact others who share that workspace. Should his liberty—indeed his freedom—to consume pornography on the job be protected at all costs, even as it undermines the equal opportunity for others around him to work and earn a living?

Most people have no difficulty saying that workers cannot consume pornography on the job because it constitutes sexual harassment. Indeed, laws and regulations that prohibit such harassment are generally understood to comply with the First Amendment. But this means freedom of speech can sometimes be constrained to further the right to equality. The reality—and challenge—is that sometimes equality gives way to freedom of speech, and vice versa.

### Myth #3: Only the Left (or Right) Hates Free Speech

Views about free speech rarely map onto political ideology in some neat way. To the contrary, history reveals that all sides across the political spectrum have sought to suppress opposing viewpoints. Currently, people on the Left are commonly faulted for seeking to limit speech that they view as racist, sexist, homophobic, fascist, or triggering. Yet at the same time, those on the Right seek to limit speech that they view as desecrating the American flag, disrespecting the national anthem, or flaunting indecency. What's interesting is that it's easy to recognize when "they" are limiting speech, but much harder to see when "we" are doing the same.

### Myth #4: Censorship is a One-Way Street

Relatedly, whenever the government comes after us, it's natural to be outraged and to assert our free speech rights. How dare you constrain my rights? But if the government goes after them—especially when they're saying things we find stupid or wicked—it's natural to start cheering. But therein lies the rub. Us and them are just flip-sides of each other.

If the government can easily go after them, a different government could just as easily come after us. We are not suggesting that there's always perfect symmetry or equivalencies; of course, context matters. Moreover, history reveals that some groups have borne the brunt of constitutional rights violations more persistently and systemically than others. But as a general rule, legal rights often work like a double-edged sword. They cut in both directions. If we have rights, so do they. If the government can shut them up today, it can shut us up tomorrow.

## PART III: WHAT'S UCLA TO DO

### The Basics

#### Regulate Unprotected Speech

Remember that certain forms of speech, such as true threats and defamation, are unprotected under the First Amendment. There's a reason why these forms of speech are unprotected (or less protected); as a general rule, it's understood that they cause concrete harm and provide little if any social value. UCLA is largely free to regulate those forms of speech and it should attempt to do so.

#### Vigorously Enforce Anti-Discrimination Laws and Norms

Multiple state and federal laws, as well as University rules and regulations, prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender (including sexual harassment), and other protected categories. Generally, these laws and regulations, which may seem to restrict speech and expressive conduct, do not violate the First Amendment. While there is some uncertainty in the law with respect to what counts as harassment, the UCLA Student Conduct Code (Section 102.11) defines harassment as "conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so substantially impairs a person's access to University programs or activities that the person is effectively denied equal access to the University's resources and opportunities."

### Show Neutrality

#### Employ Content-Neutral Restrictions

Sometimes, UCLA might want to limit speech for reasons wholly unrelated to content. Recall our time, place, and manner example involving Residential Life prohibiting students from blaring music in the dorms after midnight. The prohibition would be presumptively constitutional. Why? Remember: Residential Life doesn't care what kind of music you're playing. The office just wants your speakers off so others can sleep.

As you might already know, UCLA employs various content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations that govern speech on University property. These regulations cover, among other things, the posting of "literature, signs or personal announcements" on University property; and the use of amplified sounds; and "[s]igns, banners, and displays" on Bruin Walk. UCLA does not, however, employ "Free Speech Zones" that require students to use designated parts of campus, at designated times, to engage in free speech activities.

#### Protest: Yes | Complete Disruption: No

As administrators, our job is to allow speech and counter-speech. When a registered campus organization invites an unpopular speaker onto campus, our task is to ensure that the speaker can speak and the protesters can protest. Both constitute expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment. Neither may be suppressed simply because UCLA disagrees with the message. The hardest challenge arises when protest (or counter-protest) morphs into complete disruption of the event.

#### Discourage Heckler's Veto

Suppose a controversial speaker encounters a "heckler" in the audience. The heckler stands up and starts screaming so loudly that no one else can hear the speaker (or anyone else). No actual violence is threatened, but the lecture cannot continue. On the one hand, one could describe this situation as speech on both sides: the invited speaker versus the protester. On the other hand, the heckler's contribution effectively silences the invited speaker and prevents him or her from communicating with a willing audience.

That amounts to a "Heckler's Veto," which the University frowns upon and First Amendment law does not protect. Why? Because it allows a single highly motivated individual to prevent a speaker from communicating with an entire audience. Even if you like this particular heckler, what will you do when a heckler comes after you?

If UCLA allows hecklers to shut down talks, then we're conceding power to anyone willing to show up and scream loudly enough. That sets a troubling precedent, especially for a University committed to academic freedom. And if we escort some hecklers out of the room but not others, on the basis of their viewpoint, we become complicit in conduct that potentially violates the First Amendment.

### Pick a Side

#### Proudly Proclaim our Values

Emphasizing the need to protect speech and counter-speech from violence and complete disruption presents the University as little more than crowd control. This might sound a bit unambitious. Can UCLA do anything more? Absolutely.

Even though UCLA as "sovereign" cannot suppress speech simply because it disagrees with its message, UCLA as "speaker" may pick a side and share its beliefs. UCLA can, and should, exercise the full power of its bully pulpit to speak our values. When UCLA speaks, it need not be neutral. To the contrary, UCLA may loudly and proudly embrace equity, diversity, and inclusion while fervently rejecting inequity, homogeneity, and exclusion. This includes publicly denouncing hate speech, whether that speech is expressed by members of the UCLA community or by those invited into our fold.

The CrossCheck "blog", for example, is one venue through which the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion takes a stand and proudly proclaims our institutional values.

### Reframe the Controversies

#### From Trigger Warnings to a "Heads-up" to Better Teaching

A trigger warning is essentially a "heads-up" that the discussion will address sensitive or disturbing subjects. Ironically, some people are triggered by the very concept of trigger warnings. Just hearing about such warnings fill them with emotional outrage, which makes it hard for them to focus and continue listening. We understand some of the rage. If warnings were everywhere, we could find ourselves in a culture so sensitive to audience discomfort that nothing of substance is ever said. Of course that would be troubling. Great ideas, great art, and great teaching should often make us uncomfortable.

But let's try to avoid caricature in these conversations. First, UCLA neither mandates that faculty use trigger warnings nor prevents them from doing so. It's faculty choice, which is consistent with academic freedom. Second, trigger warnings are rarely provided willy-nilly. Instead, they're usually offered by faculty who recognize that they are about to discuss particularly sensitive subject matters (such as rape or sexual violence) that, of themselves, can re-traumatize a survivor. Third, we should own the fact that many trigger warnings don't bother us at all. Take, for example, ratings for TV shows and movies that warn us of foul language, nudity, or violence. Many of the same folks who decry trigger warnings in the classroom lobbied hard for television and movies to "voluntarily" label their programming. But aren't these all just different forms of trigger warnings?

At UCLA, we think it useful to shift the frame from "trigger warnings" to a "heads-up for better teaching." If faculty learn that certain topics—without warning—will discombobulate some students—for whatever reason, including something as mundane as level of difficulty—what does sound pedagogy call for? A heads-up. It's a decent thing to do and, more important, improves learning. At bottom, that's what a University should care most about.

#### From Micro-Aggressions to Micro-Connections

Above we pointed out the simple truism that "words matter." It's obvious that grotesque insults can rattle the listener. But, subtler words can also send signals of disrespect, exclusion, or contempt. For example, if a person of Asian descent is constantly asked "where are you from," the implicit message conveyed is that Asians are forever foreigners (regardless of how many generations their family has lived in LA). The microaggressions literature gives voice to how subtler words can have a surprisingly large impact.

The pushback to this discourse is that people are being too "sensitive." That, of course, is possible. Just as the meaning of "expressive conduct" is not fully controlled by the subjective intent of the speaker, it should not be fully controlled by the subjective understanding of the listener. In truth, the social meaning of any speech act lies somewhere between speaker and listener. But once we recognize that intent is not everything (consider the claim that kneeling football players disrespect the flag, regardless of their intent), we have to admit that a speaker's honest desire not to offend does not end the discussion.

Here are the pivots: First, let's reframe the microaggressions debate into the simple observation that words matter beyond the speaker's intent and can take on a life of their own (particularly in our tweet-filled world) that the original speaker can rarely control. Second, let's move beyond lamenting the problem of micro-aggressions and actively facilitate micro-connections, the building of community across differences, one relationship at a time. At a great public research university, our goal should be to uncover unexpected commonalities, interests, perspectives across diverse categories. It's these micro-connections—comprising smiles, decency, respect, kindness, and empathy—that thicken the social mesh that keeps our community genuinely connected and resilient.

#### From "Safe Spaces" to "Safe Spaces + Brave Spaces"

On the one hand, a call for "safe spaces" should not be controversial. No one can effectively learn or work if they fear for their basic physical safety. On the other hand, some criticize "safe spaces" as a demand for "coddling" or bubble wrap that insulates us from anything we find sharp or prickly, psychologically, emotionally, or politically. This interpretation of, and hostility to, "safe spaces" shares notable features with the resistance to recognizing "micro-aggressions."

Again, let's reframe. To begin with, let's admit our need to live in at least two spheres, a private sphere and a public sphere. After a long hard day at work (public sphere), we return to our homes and families (private sphere). At work, we need to engage, perform, and produce on public terms. At home, we can chill, relax, let our hair down, recharge, and just be ourselves. We all need private spaces; without them, we'd never be able to recompose to engage the public ones.

When students, especially those from underrepresented groups, demand "safe spaces," a natural response might be that they can find one at home. But here's the tricky part: many students live, study, and work on campus. Physically, there's no real separation between work life and home life; it's all at UCLA. Also, with the rise of social media, it's increasingly difficult to keep the spheres separate. And if "school" feels hostile and if "dorm" life feels threatening, where are students supposed to go to recharge?

So, for those skeptical about "safe spaces," we ask for a bit of empathy, and the recognition that private spheres of refuge are necessary yet not equally available to all. For those enamored with "safe spaces," we ask for openness to the idea that safe spaces are most important because they co-exist with "brave spaces," places (such as the classroom) where we intentionally put ourselves "out there," to challenge our thoughts, ideas, and assumptions. To satisfy its mission, the University must ensure that all students can access both "safe spaces" and "brave spaces." To put this another way, "safe spaces" and "brave spaces" are not in tension with each other. The existence of "safe spaces" increases the likelihood that students will indeed be "brave."

## PARTING THOUGHTS

### Walk our Values

They say that it's easy to "talk the talk," but hard to "walk the walk." Though even talking about these subjects isn't necessarily easy, we know that speaking our values is not enough. UCLA should walk those values as well. We have already said that the University should vigorously enforce our anti-discrimination laws and norms. In addition, UCLA should continue its efforts to diversify the university; to facilitate the development of programmatic and curricular initiatives that advance and reflect its commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion; and proactively work to ensure that no student feels barred from participating in the multiple dimensions of campus life because of their social group membership.

### Your Voice Matters

We opened by stating our goal to engage earnestly the difficult topic of free speech on college campuses. We were also clear to note that this document is a work-in-progress. We don't presume to have every answer or to have gotten everything right. At the same time, we are confident that none of these issues will go away anytime soon. Students and faculty will continue to invite controversial speakers to campus. Some of those speakers will bring along with them "hateful but protected speech." Students and members of the public will protest and counter-protest. Some of those protests will be disruptive, even reaching the point of a "heckler's veto." And the University will have to carry on, governing as it must, negotiating all of the tensions we explored, managing the contestable line between "what is" and what "should be" the law, and ensuring that its commitment to free speech and academic freedom does not subordinate or eviscerate its commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion.

At the outset, we encouraged you to share some views. We sincerely hope you will do so by emailing us at WeListen@equity.ucla.edu (remember to include "Free Speech Guidance" in the subject line). It remains our intention to reflect, to revise, and to reiterate. Your comments, and especially your criticisms, are crucial to that effort. Which is to say, your voice matters to us—and to the university writ large.
