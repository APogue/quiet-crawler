By David Myers
April 2, 2024 10:22 p.m.
Since Oct. 7, our campus – like so many across the country – has been the site of intense and often tense discourse and action. The divide between those who support the cause of Palestinian liberation and those who support Israel’s right to exist has deepened more than at any point in my 32 years at UCLA, creating a seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the two sides.

It has also created, at various points in time, a sense of unsafety among many members of the university community, especially students. This too tracks larger national trends, according to a 2024 report that shows that 56% of Jewish university students polled after Oct. 7 felt in personal danger, and 52% of Muslim students felt in personal danger.

It is not just a sense of safety that has fallen into the abyss. It is the ability to grasp complexity and nuance in making sense of the violent world we live in.

Sadly, there are too few voices – at least, audible ones – that are willing to acknowledge, at once, the Hamas-perpetrated massacre of Oct. 7 and the ongoing devastation that Israel has wrought in Gaza. In fact, it is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land they inhabit.

Another victim of the current moment is the ability to extend beyond ourselves to understand the other, especially those with whom one disagrees. A startling example of that failing appeared on our campus March 20 to 21 in the form of a statue placed near the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center, where the UC Board of Regents was meeting. The regents’ meeting attracted protesters who bore signs and uttered chants calling for divestment from companies that have ties to the Israeli military. Alongside these signs, someone placed in the designated free speech area next to the regents’ meeting a statue that depicted a pig holding a bag of money in one hand and a birdcage with a keffiyeh in the other.

To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible not to recoil. Since the 13th century, Jews have been associated with pigs – or, more accurately, with their coarse and animal-like quality. Medieval Christian Europe was replete with statues and carvings of the Judensau, the so-called “Jews’ pig,” which depicted Jews suckling at the udders of a sow. The image of this desperate and filthy act stands in stark contrast to the religiously mandated abstinence of Jews from consuming pork.

Indeed, for Jews – as well as for Muslims – the pig is the epitome of uncleanliness, reflecting the kind of perverse paradox on which anti-Jewish and other group-based hate rests. Ironic as the association may have been, it did not die in the Middle Ages; rather, it became a feature of Nazi propaganda that cast Jews as Judenschwein, meaning Jewish pigs. And since that time, antisemites have equated Jews with pigs, or worse, hurled pig parts at Jews to express their revulsion.

So too the juxtaposition between a hand holding a birdcage – presumably to symbolize the lack of freedom of Palestinians – and a hand holding a bag of money triggers alarms for those familiar with the history of antisemitism. Haters of Jews, such as the late 19th-century French author Édouard Drumont, have repeatedly cast them as avaricious, money-grubbing, materialistic and intent on global economic domination. Antisemites branded the Rothschilds, the wealthy European Jewish banking family, as the living embodiment of the Jewish quest to monopolize the world for their own self-interest.

It is hard not to see the staging of the two hands – the upper hand holding money and the lower hand holding the birdcage – as a visual representation of Jews’ domination of Palestinians. But what would seem to be the real tell with respect to the statue’s ultimate meaning is the blue and white bucket at the bottom left of the pig, which is emblazoned with a star of David.

Again, to anyone familiar with the repertoire of antisemitic images, it is hard to regard the assemblage of the pig, bag of money and star of David as anything other than a case of antisemitism that taps into deeply ingrained stereotypes.

In our current moment, when we vilify first and ask second, it is necessary to ask the builders of the statue: What did you have in mind? Did you have some other aim or intent than to trigger antisemitic associations? Were you trying to excoriate Israel in some way without identifying it with Jews, avarice and a pig?

If so, then it is important to recognize that the statue was deeply wounding to many members of the campus community. The cause of justice, equality and freedom for Palestinians, which many Jews strongly support, will not be advanced by recourse to antisemitic stereotypes. Even if such an offense were not your intent, it was the effect.

A good next step would be to learn more about the history of antisemitism so as to resist

Campus condemns antisemitic caricature at UC Regents meeting
March 28, 2024

share iconShare
UCLA issued a statement in response to an appalling and hateful display at a UC Board of Regents meeting.

We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University of California Board of Regents meeting on our campus in mid-March. The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been removed. Hateful and racist depictions like this are a complete affront to UCLA’s Principles of Community and True Bruin Values, and to the diverse, inclusive academic community we aim to cultivate. 

It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity. We remain committed to doing all we can to support the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus.

UCLA Condemns “Ugly Antisemitic” Pig Display
Demonstration was outside meeting of UC Board of Regents

UCLA issued a statement denouncing a display depicting a pig holding a bag of cash and a Star of David cannister that was on campus earlier this week.

The Israel War Room X account posted an image of the display on Thursday, March 21; the display had the words “UC Regents” in front of flames and a clock behind it that said, “Time is running out.” The display was in front of the UCLA Luskin Conference Center, where the UC Board of Regents were holding their meeting.

In an email to community members on Thursday, UCLA Hillel Executive Director Dan Gold wrote that “BDS activists camped out” and made a scene, including “ugly displays and slogans.” “This has become routine … yet we cannot accept it as normal!” he added. Gold told the Journal in a text message that Jewish students “were very disturbed, upset and concerned” about the pig display.

“The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a University of California campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing every day. Students and faculty across California are impacted by this hateful bigotry and it must come to an end.” – Jeffrey Abrams

Anti-Defamation League Los Angeles Regional Director Jeffrey I. Abrams said in a statement posted to social media, “The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a University of California campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing every day. Students and faculty across California are impacted by this hateful bigotry and it must come to an end.” Abrams urged the UC Regents to “denounce this antisemitic display and make clear that there is no tolerance for antisemitism on University campuses. Their silence on this issue is complicity.”

In a Friday statement to the Journal, the university said: “We are offended and deeply saddened by the ugly antisemitic caricature that was displayed as part of a protest aimed at the University of California Board of Regents that met at UCLA on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. The protest has ended and the display has been removed. Ethnic slurs and racist depictions are an affront to UCLA’s Principles of Community and True Bruin Values, and to the diverse, inclusive academic community we aim to cultivate. It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity, and we remain committed to doing all we can to ensure the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus.”

Gold also noted in his email that the UC Regents President Michael Drake announced during the meeting that the 10 UC campuses will be partnering with the Hillel Campus Initiative, which Gold called “a welcome and necessary step to better address campus antisemitism and take meaningful action to ensure our campuses are free of hate and fully accepting and inclusionary for all Jewish students, faculty and community members.”

According to The Los Angeles Times, one of the issues discussed during the UC Regents meeting was a proposal requiring faculty departments to put any polemical commentary statements up to a vote before posting and clarifying who exactly they are speaking on behalf of. The proposal would also require that faculty polemical commentary be posted on a webpage clearly marked as an opinion page that’s not speaking on the behalf of the university. The proposal has been tabled until May; when it was first introduced by Regent Jay Sures, pro-Palestinian protesters shouted “shame on you!” and accused Sures of attempting to censor their point of view.

Also during the meeting, Jewish students spoke out during public comment, where they denounced the “growing harassment against faculty and students who support Israel, including a ‘barrage’ of unjustified negative student evaluations of faculty, classes disrupted by protests, swastikas painted on buildings and signs calling Jews ‘the new Nazis,’” the Times reported. A pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest “from firms that support the ‘ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing’ of Palestinians,” per the Times.

Main text: "UCLA: A figure depicting Jews as pigs suggesting Jews "prioritize money over lives"."
Secondary text: "Remember, it's "Anti-Zionism" only, definitely not Antisemitism...."

The Photo Below the Text Description
A full-color photograph of a life-size satirical sculpture or “effigy” displayed outdoors on a paved quad with grass, trees, and a campus building visible in the background. The centerpiece is a humanoid figure with:

The head is a round, bright-pink papier-mâché pig’s head with pointed ears, two black dot eyes, a snout with two dark nostrils, and a wide grey grin showing square teeth. The torso and clothing consist of a black suit jacket, a white dress-shirt collar peeking out, a red pocket square in the left breast pocket, and a loose rope “tie” hanging from the neck. The arms are long, thin, hot-pink pig arms, both held straight out to either side in a broad “T” shape. The right hand (viewer’s left) is gripping a large grey cloth sack printed with a bold black dollar-sign; the sack hangs heavy, suggesting it is full of money. The left hand (viewer’s right) has a wrist wrapped in a black-and-white keffiyeh-patterned cloth, and from it dangles a small wire birdcage holding plastic flowers. The backdrop sign is a white circular disk mounted behind the pig’s head on a pole, with two thick black arrows pointing diagonally upward, crossing like clock hands at eleven-and-two o’clock. Curved red lettering around the rim reads “TIME IS RUNNING OUT.” The base platform is a low rectangular wooden pallet painted orange. Around the pig’s legs are crumpled, bright-red and yellow tissue “flames,” suggesting the figure is burning. The front edge displays a cardboard sign in varsity-style red-outlined letters: “UC REGENTS.” At ground level, in front of the flames, sits a white bucket with a blue lid and a hand-drawn blue Star of David, next to several newspaper pages against the base of the pigs body. Lighting is mid-day sun from the upper left; the figure casts shadows onto the paving. The photo is taken at roughly chest height, centered on the effigy.

Context
This appears to be an official ADL statement responding to the antisemitic display at UCLA (likely referencing the pig effigy from the previous image) during a UC Regents meeting. The post serves as both documentation of the ADL's response and a call to action for the UC Regents to take a public stance against antisemitism on campus.

Overall layout
The image shows a desktop-browser view of an Instagram post. The screen is split vertically:

Left-hand panel – paused video frame
Subject: A large, handmade effigy occupies almost the entire left column.

Head & expression: The head is a bright-pink papier-mâché pig with a wide, toothy grin, up-turned snout, arched eyebrows, and angry-looking eyes painted in black and white. Two stubby ears poke out of the top.

Accessory above the head: Stuck behind the head is a white circular clock mounted on a stick. Only the lower edge and a couple of red capital letters of its message are visible inside this crop.

Body & clothing: The figure wears an oversized navy-blue men’s blazer with a small red pocket square. Its stick-arms stretch outward at shoulder height as if gesturing. A heavy metal chain drapes around one shoulder. Figure appears to have a noose around its neck with the end of the twine/rope attached to the base platform, or maybe attached to a sign at the front of the base reading "REGENT" (the entire word is cropped in this video still).

Lower section / symbolism: From the mannequin’s waist down, vivid red-orange tissue paper flames billow upward, suggesting the effigy is burning. Mixed into the “fire” are scattered newspaper articles, and a blue-and-white bucket bearing the Star of David. A cardboard placard on the front edge of the base shows part of a phrase with the visible part reading “REGENTS” in large red letters with black outline.

Setting: The effigy stands on the outdoor concrete plaza in front of tall glass doors of a modern building. Reflections in the glass hint at sunny weather.

Background figures: Off to the right, two individuals in casual clothes stand chatting. One wears a white T-shirt with a colorful back-print, black pants, and white sneakers. It also looks like the same individual is wearing a white scarf draped around their neck with black pattern, maybe a keffiyeh. Their faces are turned away from the camera.

Video UI: A mute/speaker icon sits in the bottom-right corner of the video thumbnail.

Bold username “ucladivest” followed by a small timestamp “17w” (17 weeks prior to image capture) precedes the caption.

Caption excerpt (first two paragraphs visible before the scroll bar cuts it off):

“During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in to demand the UC Regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians.

During these 3 days, UC Divest shut it down through various actions such as propping up Tent City, students camping out near Luskin Conference Center, making our presence inescapable to the Regents and showcasing a reminder of the disparate conditions many Palestinian refugees face due to ongoing genocide.”

I’m sorry peoples feelings are hurt because some 19 year olds are overzealous and don’t know how to stop the *CHILDREN BEING STARVED BY THE IDF AND ISRAELI CITIZENS* so they made an extreme and offensive statement to gain attraction to their cause.

    But how is it anti semitism? What does it have to do with jews? You can't make a religious state and then when people don't agree with your government, you shift blame to them being a bigot...makes ZERO sense

        Because the display has absolutely nothing to do with the state of Israel and/or its recent actions in Gaza. It has everything to do with Jewish symbols and gross stereotypes. In other words it targets, Jews, not just Israelis or Zionists. 

But you know this.

This isn't new. The racial quotas used by many Universities now in the name of "Equity" were similar to the ones used a hundred years ago to keep out Jews from Universities.

It looks like a commentary on Israel's atrocities in Gaza and the regents support. You can be anti-Israeli policies that's causing a humanitarian catastrophe (starvation of millions, murder of 10s of thousands) without being anti-semitic.

    Coming back to this after my initial response a few hours ago to see a vibrant discussion. One thing that strikes me is how people are viewing this same effigy in very different ways depending on their own colored lenses / world view.

For many readers, myself included, this is very clearly a denunciation of the political situation in Israel and Gaza and the UC Regents role in it. I see NO anti-Semitic tropes here. The Israeli flag is essential as a symbol of Israel (no it's not a commentary on Jews). The Palestinian scarf is necessary as a symbol of Palestinians in Gaza with what seems to be flowers for their graves. The depiction of the regents as pigs shows them as greedy, not as Jewish (what does that even mean?). The money shows how the regents have prioritized money. Others have more eloquently described the meaning behind this protest.

One commenter below claimed that:

>pig person holding money bags next to Jewish star = pure antisemitism.

This appears to be a purposeful or subconscious misinterpretation of the symbolism. Again, pigs depict the regents. Money bags are how the regents hands are tied by greed and prioritizing money over Palestinian lives (which are seen in the pig's other hand, as symbolized by the Palestinian scarf). The Jewish star is on the Israeli flag - it's not representing Jews - it's representing Israel.

This is so clearly a political statement against Israeli policy of indiscriminate death and destruction in Gaza, and a denunciation of UC Regents milk toast response.

And nope, not everything denouncing Israeli policy is anti-Semitic. If we can't denounce atrocities being committed by governments and regimes due to fear of being labeled an anti-Semite (or anti-whatever depending on the country), it will be a very scary world indeed.

        you’re right that you can be anti israel without being antisemitic. its very easy. many jews have been anti israel since before you guys even cared. so i don’t understand why its difficult to grasp how and why this is antisemitic, and why you guys refuse to listen to jews when they tell you something is antisemitic. i’m not speaking about zionists who claim someone breathing is antisemitic, i’m talking about jews with legitimate fears because they HAVE to be knowledgeable on all forms of antisemitism, and this is a big in your face one. to deny that is actually disgusting, and shows that you would rather shut down a group with valid fears than acknowledge something you could look up yourself.

You're right, btw, how do you feel about my depiction of the Asian regent as a monkey holding chopsticks over Africa? It's to denounce his milktoast response to China predatory exploitation.

I’m interpreting the intent of this symbolism through my worldview based on my lived experience as a Jew. For you to explain that away as “a purposeful or subconscious misinterpretation” is gross. Read the comments on r/Jewish from where this was crossposted. Are you going to flippantly explain away all of their fear, pain, anger and disgust as “purposeful or subconscious misinterpretation” as well?
