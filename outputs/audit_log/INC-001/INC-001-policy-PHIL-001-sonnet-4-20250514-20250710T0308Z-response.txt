## Expression and Speech of Any Kind {#expression-and-speech}

### What's In: Expressive Conduct

"The First Amendment's 'freedom of speech' not only protects oral speech but also 'expressive conduct,' which includes any conduct intended to communicate an idea or message that can be reasonably understood. Consequently, 'freedom of speech' could cover texting with emojis, wearing a black armband, flashing a gang sign, burning a cross, wearing a particular type of hat, or kneeling during the national anthem."

### What's Out: Categorical Exceptions

"The Supreme Court has carved out various categories of speech as 'unprotected speech' or 'less protected speech.' Here's the main list:

• incitement of imminent lawless action;
• fighting words (addressed at a specific individual to trigger an immediate fistfight);
• true threats;
• defamation (false statements of fact published with a particularly reckless state of mind that harms reputation);
• obscenity (which is not quite the same as pornography);
• harassment;
• and child pornography (which involves actual minors).

If your speech falls into one of these categories—which are all legal terms of art—state actors need little justification to constrain or punish that speech."

### Content-based Restrictions: Presumptively Bad

"Content-based restrictions are generally unconstitutional. Thus, if a university wants to ban speech because of the content of the message (e.g., speech about abortion, or affirmative action, or Middle East politics), it is really, really hard to do consistent with the First Amendment."

### But, "Hate Speech" is Protected Speech

"Lots of people say 'Hate Speech is NOT Free Speech.' But this inaccurately describes the law: there is no categorical exception for 'hate speech.' Notwithstanding the harm it causes, 'hate speech' is protected speech. We understand and appreciate the instinct to bar 'hate speech,' particularly on a college campus, and particularly given our country's legacy of genocide, slavery, exclusion, internment, and Jim Crow, and the ongoing ways in which speech is deployed to marginalize groups (for instance, transgendered people) and challenge even their most basic rights to exist, free from violence. But as a descriptive statement of law, the assertion 'hate speech is not free speech' is just plain wrong. The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws—including university 'speech codes'—that penalize or otherwise regulate 'hate speech.'"

### Regulate Unprotected Speech

"Remember that certain forms of speech, such as true threats and defamation, are unprotected under the First Amendment. There's a reason why these forms of speech are unprotected (or less protected); as a general rule, it's understood that they cause concrete harm and provide little if any social value. UCLA is largely free to regulate those forms of speech and it should attempt to do so."

### Proudly Proclaim our Values

"Even though UCLA as 'sovereign' cannot suppress speech simply because it disagrees with its message, UCLA as 'speaker' may pick a side and share its beliefs. UCLA can, and should, exercise the full power of its bully pulpit to speak our values. When UCLA speaks, it need not be neutral. To the contrary, UCLA may loudly and proudly embrace equity, diversity, and inclusion while fervently rejecting inequity, homogeneity, and exclusion. This includes publicly denouncing hate speech, whether that speech is expressed by members of the UCLA community or by those invited into our fold."

## Visual Displays, Effigies, Sculptures, or Symbolic Objects {#visual-displays}

### Expressive Conduct Examples

"The First Amendment's 'freedom of speech' not only protects oral speech but also 'expressive conduct,' which includes any conduct intended to communicate an idea or message that can be reasonably understood. Consequently, 'freedom of speech' could cover texting with emojis, wearing a black armband, flashing a gang sign, burning a cross, wearing a particular type of hat, or kneeling during the national anthem."

### Content-Neutral Restrictions on Signs and Displays

"As you might already know, UCLA employs various content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations that govern speech on University property. These regulations cover, among other things, the posting of 'literature, signs or personal announcements' on University property; and the use of amplified sounds; and '[s]igns, banners, and displays' on Bruin Walk."

### Harassment Through Images

"Consider the messy example of harassment, which can include sexual harassment or racial harassment. Sexual harassment violates UC policy and can violate employment and education law. But how does harassment take place? Often through words and expressive conduct (as in pictures). If some coworker insists on pinning pornography to his cubicle walls, those images will predictably impact others who share that workspace."

---

## Demonstrations or Protests at University Events {#demonstrations-protests}

### Protest: Yes | Complete Disruption: No

"As administrators, our job is to allow speech and counter-speech. When a registered campus organization invites an unpopular speaker onto campus, our task is to ensure that the speaker can speak and the protesters can protest. Both constitute expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment. Neither may be suppressed simply because UCLA disagrees with the message. The hardest challenge arises when protest (or counter-protest) morphs into complete disruption of the event."

### Discourage Heckler's Veto

"Suppose a controversial speaker encounters a 'heckler' in the audience. The heckler stands up and starts screaming so loudly that no one else can hear the speaker (or anyone else). No actual violence is threatened, but the lecture cannot continue. On the one hand, one could describe this situation as speech on both sides: the invited speaker versus the protester. On the other hand, the heckler's contribution effectively silences the invited speaker and prevents him or her from communicating with a willing audience.

That amounts to a 'Heckler's Veto,' which the University frowns upon and First Amendment law does not protect. Why? Because it allows a single highly motivated individual to prevent a speaker from communicating with an entire audience. Even if you like this particular heckler, what will you do when a heckler comes after you?

If UCLA allows hecklers to shut down talks, then we're conceding power to anyone willing to show up and scream loudly enough. That sets a troubling precedent, especially for a University committed to academic freedom. And if we escort some hecklers out of the room but not others, on the basis of their viewpoint, we become complicit in conduct that potentially violates the First Amendment."

### Show Neutrality

"Sometimes, UCLA might want to limit speech for reasons wholly unrelated to content. Recall our time, place, and manner example involving Residential Life prohibiting students from blaring music in the dorms after midnight. The prohibition would be presumptively constitutional. Why? Remember: Residential Life doesn't care what kind of music you're playing. The office just wants your speakers off so others can sleep."

## Religious, Ethnic, or National Origin Content {#religious-ethnic-content}

### Content-Based Restrictions Examples

"Content-based restrictions are generally unconstitutional. Thus, if a university wants to ban speech because of the content of the message (e.g., speech about abortion, or affirmative action, or Middle East politics), it is really, really hard to do consistent with the First Amendment."

### Hate Speech and Protected Categories

"Lots of people say 'Hate Speech is NOT Free Speech.' But this inaccurately describes the law: there is no categorical exception for 'hate speech.' Notwithstanding the harm it causes, 'hate speech' is protected speech. We understand and appreciate the instinct to bar 'hate speech,' particularly on a college campus, and particularly given our country's legacy of genocide, slavery, exclusion, internment, and Jim Crow, and the ongoing ways in which speech is deployed to marginalize groups (for instance, transgendered people) and challenge even their most basic rights to exist, free from violence."

### Anti-Discrimination Laws and Protected Categories

"Multiple state and federal laws, as well as University rules and regulations, prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender (including sexual harassment), and other protected categories. Generally, these laws and regulations, which may seem to restrict speech and expressive conduct, do not violate the First Amendment."

### Harassment Definition

"While there is some uncertainty in the law with respect to what counts as harassment, the UCLA Student Conduct Code (Section 102.11) defines harassment as 'conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so substantially impairs a person's access to University programs or activities that the person is effectively denied equal access to the University's resources and opportunities.'"

### Micro-Aggressions Example

"Above we pointed out the simple truism that 'words matter.' It's obvious that grotesque insults can rattle the listener. But, subtler words can also send signals of disrespect, exclusion, or contempt. For example, if a person of Asian descent is constantly asked 'where are you from,' the implicit message conveyed is that Asians are forever foreigners (regardless of how many generations their family has lived in LA). The microaggressions literature gives voice to how subtler words can have a surprisingly large impact."

### Flag and National Anthem Speech

"Currently, people on the Left are commonly faulted for seeking to limit speech that they view as racist, sexist, homophobic, fascist, or triggering. Yet at the same time, those on the Right seek to limit speech that they view as desecrating the American flag, disrespecting the national anthem, or flaunting indecency."

## Time, Place, and Manner Regulations {#time-place-manner}

### Content-Neutral Restrictions: Presumptively Good

"Suppose Residential Life doesn't want music blaring in the dorms after midnight? They don't care whether you're playing Bieber or Drake, Mozart or Chopin, a podcast or a movie. If you're forced to turn off your speakers because people need their sleep, is that unconstitutional? It is your speech after all.

It turns out that the First Amendment is (appropriately) more flexible and tolerant of 'content-neutral' speech restrictions – that is, restrictions unrelated to the content of someone's speech. Another label for them is 'time, place, and manner' restrictions because they concern precisely that: the time (after midnight), place (in the dorms), and manner (via loudspeakers) in which an individual may speak. In this example, UCLA just wants students to be able to sleep through the night. For content-neutral restrictions, the government need only show that it is pursuing some 'significant' interest that does not burden substantially more speech than necessary, a relatively lower burden."

### Warning About Disguised Content-Based Restrictions

"But here's the worry. Sometimes governments employ what they claim are mere 'time, place, and manner' regulations to suppress a message they dislike. For example, if these regulations are extraordinarily vague or they are unevenly applied—say, employed to censor some speakers but not others—people could reasonably question whether the constraints (or their application) are content-neutral after all."

### UCLA's Current Time, Place, and Manner Regulations

"As you might already know, UCLA employs various content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations that govern speech on University property. These regulations cover, among other things, the posting of 'literature, signs or personal announcements' on University property; and the use of amplified sounds; and '[s]igns, banners, and displays' on Bruin Walk. UCLA does not, however, employ 'Free Speech Zones' that require students to use designated parts of campus, at designated times, to engage in free speech activities."

### Employ Content-Neutral Restrictions

"Sometimes, UCLA might want to limit speech for reasons wholly unrelated to content. Recall our time, place, and manner example involving Residential Life prohibiting students from blaring music in the dorms after midnight. The prohibition would be presumptively constitutional. Why? Remember: Residential Life doesn't care what kind of music you're playing. The office just wants your speakers off so others can sleep."
