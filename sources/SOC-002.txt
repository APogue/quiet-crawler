Quote Text:
"The most recent display of Jew hatred on a University of California campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing every day. Students and faculty across California are impacted by this hateful bigotry and it must come to an end.
We ask the Regents to speak up and denounce this antisemitic display and make clear that there is no tolerance for antisemitism on University campuses. Their silence on this issue is complicity."

Context
This appears to be an official ADL statement responding to the antisemitic display at UCLA (likely referencing the pig effigy from the previous image) during a UC Regents meeting. The post serves as both documentation of the ADL's response and a call to action for the UC Regents to take a public stance against antisemitism on campus.
