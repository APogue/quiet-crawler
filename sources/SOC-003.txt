Overall layout
The image shows a desktop-browser view of an Instagram Reel. The screen is split vertically:

Left half: A paused vertical video (Reel) featuring the same pig effigy seen earlier.

Right half: The Instagram sidebar with the Reel’s creator, caption, user comments, like count, and date.

1. Video panel (left side)
Story header bar (top-left corner of the video frame):
- Circular avatar with a red-orange gradient ring (story indicator).
- Username “sjpatucla” followed by “21 h” (indicating the clip was posted 21 hours ago).
- A thin progress bar stretches across the top edge.

Video still:
- Bright daytime shot of the pig effigy standing in front of tall glass doors labelled SOUTH EAST ENTRY on a modern campus building.
- Pig head, money-bag arm (left), and out-stretched right arm are clearly visible.
- The circular sign above the head now reads, in full, “TIME IS RUNNING OUT” with two thick black arrows crossing like clock hands.

On-screen text overlay (center-bottom of video):
- Large serif font in metallic silver: “ANTIZIONISM = ANTISEMITISM” (all caps, with a thin black shadow).

Super-imposed comment card (directly beneath that text):
- Black rounded-rectangle resembling an Instagram comment pop-up.
- Username: Jeanne (white text).
- Comment text:
  Antizionism isn’t Antisemitism! They need to stop conflating the two. I hate Zionists but have no issues with Jews
- Tiny grey footer shows “11 m Reply” plus a heart outline icon.

Mute button (bottom-right corner of the video): Small speaker icon with a diagonal slash.

2. Sidebar panel (right side)
Top bar:
- Text “danielleyablonka and 2 others” (white) indicating shared audio or collaboration.
- Ellipsis icon (three horizontal dots) on the far right.

Label just below: “Original audio” (grey, italic).

Main caption block:
- Creator avatar: Black-and-white profile photo.
- Username (bold white): danielleyablonka followed by a small blue verification tick.
- Timestamp: “62 w” (62 weeks ago).
- Caption text (white, line-wrapped):
  TODAY at UCLA, Students for Justice in Palestine set up a sculpture depicting Jews [correction, ZIONISTS] as money hungry pigs. Ancient antisemitism. At this point, they don’t even try to hide it… will there be any repercussions?!?
