They seem to be calling the UC Regents Zionist pigs... I really sat back and wondered how in the world Hitler was ever allowed to come into power but honestly...I get it now....

    As long as Satanists didn’t make it.  They probably didn’t either, Satanists actually have quite a bit less edge and quite a bit more class.

It honestly looks like the CUNY and UC systems might be shutting their doors for Jews. Bad news for UC Berkeley grad students because they have been considered the creme de la creme for physics and math students for a long time.

        I've talked to students at UC Berkeley, and it seems that after Oct 7 a lot of the faculty and student groups were not very supportive of Jewish students. And looking at more recent events, they failed to protect Jewish students when a mob of 200 people stormed a speaking event yelling about 'dirty Jews' and they gave a tepid response that didn't name antisemitism as a problem https://jewishinsider.com/2024/03/university-of-california-berkeley-antisemitism-jewish-students/

Honestly, I send my Jewish child to a Jesuit school and it was the best decision she and I made. Religion courses are mandatory- so that’s her Jewish studies. The school has a Judaic Center with a Rabbi on campus. One of her professors is the President of the Jewish Heritage Museum in NYC. The school sponsored a synopsis on the dangers of anti-semitism. I am sorry to see what is happening at UCLA and other campuses. It’s so disheartening to see.

    not Jewish here (raised to be catholic, that didn't work lol, now apatheist), but i also went to a Jesuit school.i have to second that teaching about religion (ALL religions) is mandatory, and in my case, was exceptional.


this is i big part of the reason i have had Jewish friends and am able to understand (i think) a lot of the complexities and cross cultural interactions. this is also why i understand where to stand.

I can’t say enough about the Jesuit approach. It has been such a blessing. My daughter is a freshman this year. She started with Jewish studies as in intro and will evolve into learning about other religions in the years to come. I really feel that If everyone had a better understanding of religions- we all would be better off. 

I also love that the Jesuit schools don’t embrace fraternities or sororities.

    I went to uni at a Jesuit university and slept in the dorms where the priests had quarters, so got many chances at interesting theological or philosophical conversations I the mess hall. Not only it was an awesome place of learning, but the people who ran it were pure gold. Always so respectful of my Jewishness and basically used me as a Hebrew dictionary at times lol.

I mean the Amcha initiative came out with a pretty scathing report in terms of UC system antisemetism: https://amchainitiative.org/anti-zionist-faculty-report-3-20-24pr/

And many of the schools are being investigated for ongoing antisemetism by the education department. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-14/federal-civil-rights-probes-launched-into-ucla-uc-san-diego-and-other-california-campuses

And therr is a lawsuit against the UC system and UC Berkeley right now for unchecked antisemetism https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/28/jewish-groups-university-california-antisemitism-lawsuit-00128772

As someone who went to one UC school and taught at another it's rough to read what is happening there.
