The Photo Below the Text Description
A full-color photograph of a life-size satirical sculpture or “effigy” displayed outdoors on a paved quad with grass, trees, and a campus building visible in the background. The centerpiece is a humanoid figure with:

The head is a round, bright-pink papier-mâché pig’s head with pointed ears, two black dot eyes, a snout with two dark nostrils, and a wide grey grin showing square teeth. The torso and clothing consist of a black suit jacket, a white dress-shirt collar peeking out, a red pocket square in the left breast pocket, and a loose rope “tie” hanging from the neck. The arms are long, thin, hot-pink pig arms, both held straight out to either side in a broad “T” shape. The right hand (viewer’s left) is gripping a large grey cloth sack printed with a bold black dollar-sign; the sack hangs heavy, suggesting it is full of money. The left hand (viewer’s right) has a wrist wrapped in a black-and-white keffiyeh-patterned cloth, and from it dangles a small wire birdcage holding plastic flowers. The backdrop sign is a white circular disk mounted behind the pig’s head on a pole, with two thick black arrows pointing diagonally upward, crossing like clock hands at eleven-and-two o’clock. Curved red lettering around the rim reads “TIME IS RUNNI…”—the rest is obscured but implies “TIME IS RUNNING OUT.” The base platform is a low rectangular wooden pallet painted orange. Around the pig’s legs are crumpled, bright-red and yellow tissue “flames,” suggesting the figure is burning. The front edge displays a cardboard sign in varsity-style red-outlined letters: “UC REGENTS.” At ground level, in front of the flames, sits a white bucket with a blue lid and a hand-drawn blue Star of David, next to several newspaper pages against the base of the pigs body. Lighting is mid-day sun from the upper left; the figure casts shadows onto the paving. The photo is taken at roughly chest height, centered on the effigy.
