        It was especially comical considering how quickly some of these same posters will quickly find racism and sexism elsewhere yet they twist themselves in knots explaining how this couldn't possibly be anti-Semitic and if it was, it was all a mere coincidence.

        You are a fool if you believe that the above comment expressed anything but liberal sympathies to the Israeli apartheid. 

I’m sorry peoples feelings are hurt because some 19 year olds are overzealous and don’t know how to stop the *CHILDREN BEING STARVED BY THE IDF AND ISRAELI CITIZENS* so they made an extreme and offensive statement to gain attraction to their cause.

    But how is it anti semitism? What does it have to do with jews? You can't make a religious state and then when people don't agree with your government, you shift blame to them being a bigot...makes ZERO sense

        Because the display has absolutely nothing to do with the state of Israel and/or its recent actions in Gaza. It has everything to do with Jewish symbols and gross stereotypes. In other words it targets, Jews, not just Israelis or Zionists. 

But you know this.

This isn't new. The racial quotas used by many Universities now in the name of "Equity" were similar to the ones used a hundred years ago to keep out Jews from Universities.

    I thought I was crazy at first but honestly it seems like leftists think it’s ok to ostracize a group of people as long as they’re white. They’re white so they’re seen as the oppressor by default, and ‘it’s not possible to be racist against white ppl, you guys!’

I never thought I’d live to see a day where the subreddit of the most left leaning campuses in the country would be excusing a statue of a burning pig holding a bag of money next to a Star of David.

Something to remember in condemning Israeli war crimes is that you don’t just get to commit wholesale antisemitism and not be called on it.

The problem is not JEWS, it is the Israeli government and military.

    Exactly this. You can be Pro-Palestine as much and as loudly as you want, but when you do stuff like this, or what I’ve seen where ppl will go into holocaust survivor videos and somehow blame them for the creation of Israel(99.99% of the time they weren’t, don’t really need to say that), you’re not being Pro-Palestine, you’re just being a Anti-Semite

        The genuinely crazy part of all this to me is how cruel the Israeli government is about Holocaust survivors and victims. They don’t give half a shit about those poor people. They care about money and favors from Christian evangelists, and nothing else.

    Why the fuck are you defending an ethnostate. Ethnostates are bad. The foundation of Isr*el literally involved massacring Palestinians and pushing 750,000 Palestinians off their land to secure a demographic majority.

That's not a good thing. If you truly care about Jewish people you would want to address the fundamental problem that they have historically which is the world being incredibly horrible to them. And the fight for Jewish people in America to be safe and not harrassed and otherwise hurt is inextricably tied to other movements like fighting for islamophobia, and black people and disabled people and LGBT rights. We don't make ethnostates if people are oppressed, we fight tooth and nail against the oppression. There is a long history of Jews in America doing exactly that.

Zionism is a slap in the face of all of that.

        Ethnostates are what works in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Maybe Europeans can make multiculturalism work, but I doubt it. Humans are a dumb tribal animal when you get down to brass tacks. It’s why the Middle east, Africa, and Asia  are all ethnostates with minorities being slowly exterminated. Lebanon is slowly chasing all the Christians out, Egypt will soon not having any copts left, and everyone knows what the Turks did to their minorities. Israel isn’t special or especially remarkable in the middle east for their brutality. Zimbabwe chased the whites away and is in the process of exterminating black tribes they don’t like. Ethiopia is currently experiencing yet another genocide.   If anything they’re a soft touch by world standards. Most other governments would have turned Gaza into a charnel house by now. Remember how Saddam dealt with the Marsh Arabs?
