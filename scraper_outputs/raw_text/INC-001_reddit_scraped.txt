They seem to be calling the UC Regents Zionist pigs... I really sat back and wondered how in the world Hitler was ever allowed to come into power but honestly...I get it now....

The insane amount of people defending it in the other post just shows how widespread this issue is nowadays.

        You would think that university students would make that connection. Sadly the second-grade level logic is lost on so many.

It looks like a commentary on Israel's atrocities in Gaza and the regents support. You can be anti-Israeli policies that's causing a humanitarian catastrophe (starvation of millions, murder of 10s of thousands) without being anti-semitic.

    Coming back to this after my initial response a few hours ago to see a vibrant discussion. One thing that strikes me is how people are viewing this same effigy in very different ways depending on their own colored lenses / world view.

For many readers, myself included, this is very clearly a denunciation of the political situation in Israel and Gaza and the UC Regents role in it. I see NO anti-Semitic tropes here. The Israeli flag is essential as a symbol of Israel (no it's not a commentary on Jews). The Palestinian scarf is necessary as a symbol of Palestinians in Gaza with what seems to be flowers for their graves. The depiction of the regents as pigs shows them as greedy, not as Jewish (what does that even mean?). The money shows how the regents have prioritized money. Others have more eloquently described the meaning behind this protest.

One commenter below claimed that:

>pig person holding money bags next to Jewish star = pure antisemitism.

This appears to be a purposeful or subconscious misinterpretation of the symbolism. Again, pigs depict the regents. Money bags are how the regents hands are tied by greed and prioritizing money over Palestinian lives (which are seen in the pig's other hand, as symbolized by the Palestinian scarf). The Jewish star is on the Israeli flag - it's not representing Jews - it's representing Israel.

This is so clearly a political statement against Israeli policy of indiscriminate death and destruction in Gaza, and a denunciation of UC Regents milk toast response.

And nope, not everything denouncing Israeli policy is anti-Semitic. If we can't denounce atrocities being committed by governments and regimes due to fear of being labeled an anti-Semite (or anti-whatever depending on the country), it will be a very scary world indeed.

        you’re right that you can be anti israel without being antisemitic. its very easy. many jews have been anti israel since before you guys even cared. so i don’t understand why its difficult to grasp how and why this is antisemitic, and why you guys refuse to listen to jews when they tell you something is antisemitic. i’m not speaking about zionists who claim someone breathing is antisemitic, i’m talking about jews with legitimate fears because they HAVE to be knowledgeable on all forms of antisemitism, and this is a big in your face one. to deny that is actually disgusting, and shows that you would rather shut down a group with valid fears than acknowledge something you could look up yourself.
