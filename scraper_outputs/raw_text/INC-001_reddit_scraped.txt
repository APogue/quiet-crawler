    Coming back to this after my initial response a few hours ago to see a vibrant discussion. One thing that strikes me is how people are viewing this same effigy in very different ways depending on their own colored lenses / world view.

For many readers, myself included, this is very clearly a denunciation of the political situation in Israel and Gaza and the UC Regents role in it. I see NO anti-Semitic tropes here. The Israeli flag is essential as a symbol of Israel (no it's not a commentary on Jews). The Palestinian scarf is necessary as a symbol of Palestinians in Gaza with what seems to be flowers for their graves. The depiction of the regents as pigs shows them as greedy, not as Jewish (what does that even mean?). The money shows how the regents have prioritized money. Others have more eloquently described the meaning behind this protest.

One commenter below claimed that:

>pig person holding money bags next to Jewish star = pure antisemitism.

This appears to be a purposeful or subconscious misinterpretation of the symbolism. Again, pigs depict the regents. Money bags are how the regents hands are tied by greed and prioritizing money over Palestinian lives (which are seen in the pig's other hand, as symbolized by the Palestinian scarf). The Jewish star is on the Israeli flag - it's not representing Jews - it's representing Israel.

This is so clearly a political statement against Israeli policy of indiscriminate death and destruction in Gaza, and a denunciation of UC Regents milk toast response.

And nope, not everything denouncing Israeli policy is anti-Semitic. If we can't denounce atrocities being committed by governments and regimes due to fear of being labeled an anti-Semite (or anti-whatever depending on the country), it will be a very scary world indeed.

        While it is possible that the creator of the display had antisemitic intentions behind the choice of the pig, the "UC REGENTS" label at the bottom makes this seem less likely to me—the message is presumably not that the Regents are all Jews, but that the Regents are "pigs", in that they are greedy people who prioritize financial gain, including through investment in Israeli companies, over the lives of the residents of Gaza. Pigs are commonly used as a symbol of greed with no ethnoreligious connotations, as several dictionaries' entries for *pig* indicate:

* "Someone who is like the popular image of a pig, dirty, greedy, gluttonous, or cantankerous (also used mildly in reproach)" (Chambers Dictionary)
* "**Informal** a greedy, dirty, or unpleasant person: *you're such a pig when it comes to sleep.*" (New Oxford American Dictionary)
* "**informal** A dirty, greedy, or bad-mannered person" (Collins English Dictionary)

If the pig was chosen with antisemitic intent, the plausible deniability provided by this usage could have also been a factor. We may never know for certain.

        Notice the words "UC REGENTS" under the pig. Clearly indicating that it is in fact representing the UC regents, putting money in the tin for Israel. 

A pig is a universal sign for greed and you could more than easily find numerous examples of capitalists and rich assholes being betrayed as pigs. You could call Animal Farm anti-Semitic, because of that reason. 

Only a couple of weeks ago people were accusing Greta Thunberg of all people of being anti-Semitic, because she had an octopus plushy. People have been racist to Jewish people for a very long time and have probably used every type of symbology that can be used. 

So, in this instance, if you parse the symbology here as literally as you can, it brushes past a lot of feelings that could be connected to totally normal anxieties about anti-semitism. But Israel isn't Judaism. And people can protest support of Israel's genocide by the regents without being anti-Semitic.

    You can oppose Israeli policy without being antisemitic, but this isn’t an example of that. Comparing Jews to pigs is an extremely common antisemitic trope. I actually don’t think you could make a more overtly antisemitic effigy if you tried.

If this were about Israel, why doesn’t it say it anywhere? It has a Star of David, but isn’t painted the way the Star of David on the Israeli flag is. Why is the pig carrying a bag of money? (It’s obviously playing on another antisemitic trope.) How are we supposed to interpret the noose around the pig’s neck? If it were about Israel and not Jews, shouldn’t the people who made it have been cautious not to use antisemitic tropes so that the message wasn’t misconstrued?

In summary, your take is complete bullshit. The point of this is clear to every Jewish person who sees it. It doesn’t matter if someone says “oh it’s actually about (((Zionists))).” I don’t think I or other Jewish students can possibly feel safe on campus when there are protests sanctioned by student organizations where the message is clearly “we want to lynch Jews”.

    Yeah but the specific symbolism used looks like it could come out of 1930's germany. It's not specifically calling out the genocide or the blocking of humanitarian aid, it's bringing together several symbols that were commonly used to associate with Jewish people in the past.

I'm against the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, but I'd probably would tip over that display if I saw it irl. I don't want to be associated with people that conflate anti-zionism with anti-semitism. Neither Hasbara nor bigots.

    97% of Jews are Zionists believe it or not and I'm not going to get into anything regarding the politics. I'm just going to say that a majority of Jews feel a VERY strong connection to Israel and its been tied to our identity for the last 3000 years. This effigy is antisemitic because it is using the judensau trope to call the UC regents Zionist pigs. What does this have to do with Jews? Because a majority of Jews are Zionists. Therefore you're calling Jews greedy Zionist pigs through this effigy. I don't care about your views on the war. What I do care about is that Jewish students should not be walking onto campus and feeling legitimately scared when they see effigies calling Jews pigs.

    Wow this would be a great point if it wasn’t an actual antisemitic effigy targeting Jews and not (((Zionists))). Do you think that the stereotypes this is playing on (Jews being greedy, Jews being associated with pigs) only cropped up after the founding of Israel? Obviously the answer is no.

As a Jew, you should be aware of your own history. Antisemites have historically used Jews to sabotage their own communities. There is exactly zero chance that this made it into the protest without awareness of the historical significance of this imagery.

this is a bit of a stretch. the movement is the Divest movement, which pushes the Regents to stop profiting from the military industrial complex. The regents (not Jewish people) are displayed as greedy pigs, pretty standard symbolism.

They’re not using “a bunch of antisemitic tropes” im not sure what you are all on about. The *Israeli* flag is present, not symbols of Judaism. Israel =/= Judaism. Are displays of police as pigs similarly “steeped in antisemitism” too? No, these are commonly used symbols for divestment movements the same as they’re commonly used symbols for abolition movements. Depictions of pigs as symbols of greed have existed in cultures around the world long before any potential contact with Jewish communities. it’s dicey, but it’s not overt

The Star of David in this "art piece" is on what looks to be a Tzedakah box. Tzedakah boxes are a symbol of Judaism, not Israel. I don't care what you think about Israel and Palestine; someone put a lot of work into making it clear that this is about the Jews.

If this were a KKK cross being burnt, nobody would say "oh, well, it's probably protesting the Sudanese genocide, why are black people upset?" If this depicted a Muslim dressed up to look like a Hamas member with an AK-47, suicide vest, blood, and symbols of Islam, nobody would say "oh, well, it's probably protesting October 7th". The protests in either case would be enormous, and either would be a national news story. To pretend otherwise is disingenuous, and to suddenly realize the importance of free speech when you would be outraged in any other case is anti-semitism.

All you’re doing is harming your own cause. While you may try to justify it however you want, people who aren’t ignorant of these stereotypes and history see it for exactly what it is and it reflects badly on your cause. If you don’t want to be labeled antisemetic, stop doing antisemetic shit.
