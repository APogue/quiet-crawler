One thing that strikes me is how people are viewing this same effigy in very different ways depending on their own colored lenses / world view.\n\nFor many readers, myself included, this is very clearly a denunciation of the political situation in Israel and Gaza and the UC Regents role in it. I see NO anti-Semitic tropes here. The Israeli flag is essential as a symbol of Israel (no it's not a commentary on Jews). The Palestinian scarf is necessary as a symbol of Palestinians in Gaza with what seems to be flowers for their graves. The depiction of the regents as pigs shows them as greedy, not as Jewish (what does that even mean?). The money shows how the regents have prioritized money. Others have more eloquently described the meaning behind this protest.\n\nOne commenter below claimed that:\n\n>pig person holding money bags next to Jewish star = pure antisemitism.\n\nThis appears to be a purposeful or subconscious misinterpretation of the symbolism. Again, pigs depict the regents. Money bags are how the regents hands are tied by greed and prioritizing money over Palestinian lives (which are seen in the pig's other hand, as symbolized by the Palestinian scarf). The Jewish star is on the Israeli flag - it's not representing Jews - it's representing Israel.\n\nThis is so clearly a political statement against Israeli policy of indiscriminate death and destruction in Gaza, and a denunciation of UC Regents milk toast response.\n\nAnd nope, not everything denouncing Israeli policy is anti-Semitic. If we can't denounce atrocities being committed by governments and regimes due to fear of being labeled an anti-Semite (or anti-whatever depending on the country), it will be a very scary world indeed.",

Ignorance isn\u2019t an excuse to perpetuate longstanding harmful stereotypes\n\nAll you\u2019re doing is harming your own cause. While you may try to justify it however you want, people who aren\u2019t ignorant of these stereotypes and history see it for exactly what it is and it reflects badly on your cause. If you don\u2019t want to be labeled antisemetic, stop doing antisemetic shit.",
